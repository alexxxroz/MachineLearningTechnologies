              "'chapter i down the rabbit holealice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on thebank  and of having nothing to do  once or twice she had peeped intothe book her sister was reading  but it had no pictures orconversations in it   and what is the use of a book   thought alice without pictures or conversations  so she was considering in her own mind  as well as she could  for thehot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid   whether the pleasure ofmaking a daisy chain would be worth the trouble of getting up andpicking the daisies  when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ranclose by her there was nothing so  very  remarkable in that  nor did alice think itso  very  much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself   ohdear  oh dear  i shall be late    when she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this  but at thetime it all seemed quite natural   but when the rabbit actually  took awatch out of its waistcoat pocket   and looked at it  and then hurriedon  alice started to her feet  for it flashed across her mind that shehad never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat pocket  or awatch to take out of it  and burning with curiosity  she ran across thefield after it  and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down alarge rabbit hole under the hedge in another moment down went alice after it  never once considering howin the world she was to get out again the rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way  and thendipped suddenly down  so suddenly that alice had not a moment to thinkabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a verydeep well either the well was very deep  or she fell very slowly  for she hadplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder whatwas going to happen next  first  she tried to look down and make outwhat she was coming to  but it was too dark to see anything  then shelooked at the sides of the well  and noticed that they were filled withcupboards and book shelves  here and there she saw maps and pictureshung upon pegs  she took down a jar from one of the shelves as shepassed  it was labelled  orange marmalade   but to her greatdisappointment it was empty  she did not like to drop the jar for fearof killing somebody underneath  so managed to put it into one of thecupboards as she fell past it  well   thought alice to herself   after such a fall as this  i shallthink nothing of tumbling down stairs  how brave they ll all think meat home  why  i wouldn t say anything about it  even if i fell off thetop of the house    which was very likely true  down  down  down  would the fall  never  come to an end   i wonder howmany miles i ve fallen by this time   she said aloud   i must begetting somewhere near the centre of the earth  let me see  that wouldbe four thousand miles down  i think    for  you see  alice had learntseveral things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom  andthough this was not a  very  good opportunity for showing off herknowledge  as there was no one to listen to her  still it was goodpractice to say it over    yes  that s about the right distance butthen i wonder what latitude or longitude i ve got to    alice had noidea what latitude was  or longitude either  but thought they were nicegrand words to say  presently she began again   i wonder if i shall fall right  through the earth  how funny it ll seem to come out among the people that walkwith their heads downward  the antipathies  i think    she was ratherglad there  was  no one listening  this time  as it didn t sound at allthe right word    but i shall have to ask them what the name of thecountry is  you know  please  ma am  is this new zealand or australia   and she tried to curtsey as she spoke fancy  curtseying  as you refalling through the air  do you think you could manage it    and whatan ignorant little girl she ll think me for asking  no  it ll never doto ask  perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere  down  down  down  there was nothing else to do  so alice soon begantalking again   dinah ll miss me very much to night  i should think   dinah was the cat    i hope they ll remember her saucer of milk attea time  dinah my dear  i wish you were down here with me  there areno mice in the air  i m afraid  but you might catch a bat  and that svery like a mouse  you know  but do cats eat bats  i wonder   and herealice began to get rather sleepy  and went on saying to herself  in adreamy sort of way   do cats eat bats  do cats eat bats   andsometimes   do bats eat cats   for  you see  as she couldn t answereither question  it didn t much matter which way she put it  she feltthat she was dozing off  and had just begun to dream that she waswalking hand in hand with dinah  and saying to her very earnestly  now  dinah  tell me the truth  did you ever eat a bat   when suddenly thump  thump  down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves  andthe fall was over alice was not a bit hurt  and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment she looked up  but it was all dark overhead  before her was anotherlong passage  and the white rabbit was still in sight  hurrying downit  there was not a moment to be lost  away went alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say  as it turned a corner   oh my earsand whiskers  how late it s getting   she was close behind it when sheturned the corner  but the rabbit was no longer to be seen  she foundherself in a long  low hall  which was lit up by a row of lamps hangingfrom the roof there were doors all round the hall  but they were all locked  and whenalice had been all the way down one side and up the other  trying everydoor  she walked sadly down the middle  wondering how she was ever toget out again suddenly she came upon a little three legged table  all made of solidglass  there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key  and alice sfirst thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall but  alas  either the locks were too large  or the key was too small but at any rate it would not open any of them  however  on the secondtime round  she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before  andbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high  she tried thelittle golden key in the lock  and to her great delight it fitted alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage  notmuch larger than a rat hole  she knelt down and looked along thepassage into the loveliest garden you ever saw  how she longed to getout of that dark hall  and wander about among those beds of brightflowers and those cool fountains  but she could not even get her headthrough the doorway   and even if my head would go through   thoughtpoor alice   it would be of very little use without my shoulders  oh how i wish i could shut up like a telescope  i think i could  if i onlyknew how to begin   for  you see  so many out of the way things hadhappened lately  that alice had begun to think that very few thingsindeed were really impossible there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door  so she wentback to the table  half hoping she might find another key on it  or atany rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes  thistime she found a little bottle on it    which certainly was not herebefore   said alice   and round the neck of the bottle was a paperlabel  with the words  drink me   beautifully printed on it in largeletters it was all very well to say  drink me   but the wise little alice wasnot going to do  that  in a hurry   no  i ll look first   she said  and see whether it s marked   poison   or not   for she had readseveral nice little histories about children who had got burnt  andeaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things  all because they would  not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them such as  that a red hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your finger  very  deeply with a knife  it usuallybleeds  and she had never forgotten that  if you drink much from abottle marked  poison   it is almost certain to disagree with you sooner or later however  this bottle was  not  marked  poison   so alice ventured totaste it  and finding it very nice   it had  in fact  a sort of mixedflavour of cherry tart  custard  pine apple  roast turkey  toffee  andhot buttered toast   she very soon finished it off                                                                                                                                what a curious feeling   said alice   i must be shutting up like atelescope  and so it was indeed  she was now only ten inches high  and her facebrightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for goingthrough the little door into that lovely garden  first  however  shewaited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further she felt a little nervous about this   for it might end  you know  said alice to herself   in my going out altogether  like a candle  iwonder what i should be like then   and she tried to fancy what theflame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out  for she couldnot remember ever having seen such a thing after a while  finding that nothing more happened  she decided on goinginto the garden at once  but  alas for poor alice  when she got to thedoor  she found she had forgotten the little golden key  and when shewent back to the table for it  she found she could not possibly reachit  she could see it quite plainly through the glass  and she tried herbest to climb up one of the legs of the table  but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out with trying  the poor little thingsat down and cried  come  there s no use in crying like that   said alice to herself rather sharply   i advise you to leave off this minute   she generallygave herself very good advice   though she very seldom followed it  and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears intoher eyes  and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for havingcheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people  but it s no use now   thought poor alice   to pretend to be twopeople  why  there s hardly enough of me left to make  one  respectableperson  soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table she opened it  and found in it a very small cake  on which the words eat me  were beautifully marked in currants   well  i ll eat it   saidalice   and if it makes me grow larger  i can reach the key  and if itmakes me grow smaller  i can creep under the door  so either way i llget into the garden  and i don t care which happens  she ate a little bit  and said anxiously to herself   which way  whichway    holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it wasgrowing  and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the samesize  to be sure  this generally happens when one eats cake  but alicehad got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out of the waythings to happen  that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to goon in the common way so she set to work  and very soon finished off the cake                                                                                                                               chapter ii the pool of tears curiouser and curiouser   cried alice  she was so much surprised  thatfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good english    now i mopening out like the largest telescope that ever was  good bye  feet   for when she looked down at her feet  they seemed to be almost out ofsight  they were getting so far off    oh  my poor little feet  iwonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now  dears  i msure  i  shan t be able  i shall be a great deal too far off to troublemyself about you  you must manage the best way you can  but i must bekind to them   thought alice   or perhaps they won t walk the way iwant to go  let me see  i ll give them a new pair of boots everychristmas  and she went on planning to herself how she would manage it   they mustgo by the carrier   she thought   and how funny it ll seem  sendingpresents to one s own feet  and how odd the directions will look       alice s right foot  esq   hearthrug  near the fender     with     alice s love   oh dear  what nonsense i m talking  just then her head struck against the roof of the hall  in fact she wasnow more than nine feet high  and she at once took up the little goldenkey and hurried off to the garden door poor alice  it was as much as she could do  lying down on one side  tolook through into the garden with one eye  but to get through was morehopeless than ever  she sat down and began to cry again  you ought to be ashamed of yourself   said alice   a great girl likeyou    she might well say this    to go on crying in this way  stopthis moment  i tell you   but she went on all the same  sheddinggallons of tears  until there was a large pool all round her  aboutfour inches deep and reaching half down the hall after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance  andshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming  it was the whiterabbit returning  splendidly dressed  with a pair of white kid glovesin one hand and a large fan in the other  he came trotting along in agreat hurry  muttering to himself as he came   oh  the duchess  theduchess  oh  won t she be savage if i ve kept her waiting   alice feltso desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one  so  when therabbit came near her  she began  in a low  timid voice   if you please sir   the rabbit started violently  dropped the white kid gloves andthe fan  and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go alice took up the fan and gloves  and  as the hall was very hot  shekept fanning herself all the time she went on talking   dear  dear  howqueer everything is to day  and yesterday things went on just as usual i wonder if i ve been changed in the night  let me think  was i thesame when i got up this morning  i almost think i can remember feelinga little different  but if i m not the same  the next question is  whoin the world am i  ah   that s  the great puzzle   and she beganthinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age asherself  to see if she could have been changed for any of them  i m sure i m not ada   she said   for her hair goes in such longringlets  and mine doesn t go in ringlets at all  and i m sure i can tbe mabel  for i know all sorts of things  and she  oh  she knows such avery little  besides   she s  she  and  i m  i  and oh dear  howpuzzling it all is  i ll try if i know all the things i used to know let me see  four times five is twelve  and four times six is thirteen and four times seven is oh dear  i shall never get to twenty at thatrate  however  the multiplication table doesn t signify  let s trygeography  london is the capital of paris  and paris is the capital ofrome  and rome no   that s  all wrong  i m certain  i must have beenchanged for mabel  i ll try and say   how doth the little     and shecrossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons  and beganto repeat it  but her voice sounded hoarse and strange  and the wordsdid not come the same as they used to do   how doth the little crocodile    improve his shining tail and pour the waters of the nile    on every golden scale  how cheerfully he seems to grin     how neatly spread his claws and welcome little fishes in    with gently smiling jaws   i m sure those are not the right words   said poor alice  and her eyesfilled with tears again as she went on   i must be mabel after all  andi shall have to go and live in that poky little house  and have next tono toys to play with  and oh  ever so many lessons to learn  no  i vemade up my mind about it  if i m mabel  i ll stay down here  it ll beno use their putting their heads down and saying  come up again  dear  i shall only look up and say  who am i then  tell me that first  andthen  if i like being that person  i ll come up  if not  i ll stay downhere till i m somebody else  but  oh dear   cried alice  with a suddenburst of tears   i do wish they  would  put their heads down  i am so very  tired of being all alone here  as she said this she looked down at her hands  and was surprised to seethat she had put on one of the rabbit s little white kid gloves whileshe was talking   how  can  i have done that   she thought   i must begrowing small again   she got up and went to the table to measureherself by it  and found that  as nearly as she could guess  she wasnow about two feet high  and was going on shrinking rapidly  she soonfound out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding  and shedropped it hastily  just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether  that  was  a narrow escape   said alice  a good deal frightened at thesudden change  but very glad to find herself still in existence   andnow for the garden   and she ran with all speed back to the littledoor  but  alas  the little door was shut again  and the little goldenkey was lying on the glass table as before   and things are worse thanever   thought the poor child   for i never was so small as thisbefore  never  and i declare it s too bad  that it is  as she said these words her foot slipped  and in another moment splash  she was up to her chin in salt water  her first idea was thatshe had somehow fallen into the sea   and in that case i can go back byrailway   she said to herself   alice had been to the seaside once inher life  and had come to the general conclusion  that wherever you goto on the english coast you find a number of bathing machines in thesea  some children digging in the sand with wooden spades  then a rowof lodging houses  and behind them a railway station   however  shesoon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept whenshe was nine feet high  i wish i hadn t cried so much   said alice  as she swam about  tryingto find her way out   i shall be punished for it now  i suppose  bybeing drowned in my own tears  that  will  be a queer thing  to besure  however  everything is queer to day  just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little wayoff  and she swam nearer to make out what it was  at first she thoughtit must be a walrus or hippopotamus  but then she remembered how smallshe was now  and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that hadslipped in like herself  would it be of any use  now   thought alice   to speak to this mouse everything is so out of the way down here  that i should think verylikely it can talk  at any rate  there s no harm in trying   so shebegan   o mouse  do you know the way out of this pool  i am very tiredof swimming about here  o mouse    alice thought this must be the rightway of speaking to a mouse  she had never done such a thing before  butshe remembered having seen in her brother s latin grammar   a mouse ofa mouse to a mouse a mouse o mouse    the mouse looked at her ratherinquisitively  and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes but it said nothing  perhaps it doesn t understand english   thought alice   i daresay it sa french mouse  come over with william the conqueror    for  with allher knowledge of history  alice had no very clear notion how long agoanything had happened   so she began again   o  est ma chatte   whichwas the first sentence in her french lesson book  the mouse gave asudden leap out of the water  and seemed to quiver all over withfright   oh  i beg your pardon   cried alice hastily  afraid that shehad hurt the poor animal s feelings   i quite forgot you didn t likecats   not like cats   cried the mouse  in a shrill  passionate voice   would you  like cats if you were me   well  perhaps not   said alice in a soothing tone   don t be angryabout it  and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah  i think you dtake a fancy to cats if you could only see her  she is such a dearquiet thing   alice went on  half to herself  as she swam lazily aboutin the pool   and she sits purring so nicely by the fire  licking herpaws and washing her face and she is such a nice soft thing tonurse and she s such a capital one for catching mice oh  i beg yourpardon   cried alice again  for this time the mouse was bristling allover  and she felt certain it must be really offended   we won t talkabout her any more if you d rather not   we indeed   cried the mouse  who was trembling down to the end of histail   as if  i  would talk on such a subject  our family always hated  cats  nasty  low  vulgar things  don t let me hear the nameagain   i won t indeed   said alice  in a great hurry to change the subject ofconversation   are you are you fond of of dogs   the mouse did notanswer  so alice went on eagerly   there is such a nice little dog nearour house i should like to show you  a little bright eyed terrier  youknow  with oh  such long curly brown hair  and it ll fetch things whenyou throw them  and it ll sit up and beg for its dinner  and all sortsof things i can t remember half of them and it belongs to a farmer  youknow  and he says it s so useful  it s worth a hundred pounds  he saysit kills all the rats and oh dear   cried alice in a sorrowful tone  i m afraid i ve offended it again   for the mouse was swimming awayfrom her as hard as it could go  and making quite a commotion in thepool as it went so she called softly after it   mouse dear  do come back again  and wewon t talk about cats or dogs either  if you don t like them   when themouse heard this  it turned round and swam slowly back to her  its facewas quite pale  with passion  alice thought   and it said in a lowtrembling voice   let us get to the shore  and then i ll tell you myhistory  and you ll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs  it was high time to go  for the pool was getting quite crowded with thebirds and animals that had fallen into it  there were a duck and adodo  a lory and an eaglet  and several other curious creatures  aliceled the way  and the whole party swam to the shore chapter iii a caucus race and a long talethey were indeed a queer looking party that assembled on the bank thebirds with draggled feathers  the animals with their fur clinging closeto them  and all dripping wet  cross  and uncomfortable the first question of course was  how to get dry again  they had aconsultation about this  and after a few minutes it seemed quitenatural to alice to find herself talking familiarly with them  as ifshe had known them all her life  indeed  she had quite a long argumentwith the lory  who at last turned sulky  and would only say   i amolder than you  and must know better   and this alice would not allowwithout knowing how old it was  and  as the lory positively refused totell its age  there was no more to be said at last the mouse  who seemed to be a person of authority among them called out   sit down  all of you  and listen to me   i ll  soon makeyou dry enough   they all sat down at once  in a large ring  with themouse in the middle  alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it  for shefelt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon  ahem   said the mouse with an important air   are you all ready  thisis the driest thing i know  silence all round  if you please   williamthe conqueror  whose cause was favoured by the pope  was soon submittedto by the english  who wanted leaders  and had been of late muchaccustomed to usurpation and conquest  edwin and morcar  the earls ofmercia and northumbria    ugh   said the lory  with a shiver  i beg your pardon   said the mouse  frowning  but very politely   didyou speak   not i   said the lory hastily  i thought you did   said the mouse    i proceed   edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria  declared for him  and evenstigand  the patriotic archbishop of canterbury  found it advisable    found  what    said the duck  found  it    the mouse replied rather crossly   of course you knowwhat  it  means   i know what  it  means well enough  when  i  find a thing   said theduck   it s generally a frog or a worm  the question is  what did thearchbishop find  the mouse did not notice this question  but hurriedly went on     foundit advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william and offer himthe crown  william s conduct at first was moderate  but the insolenceof his normans   how are you getting on now  my dear   it continued turning to alice as it spoke  as wet as ever   said alice in a melancholy tone   it doesn t seem todry me at all   in that case   said the dodo solemnly  rising to its feet   i movethat the meeting adjourn  for the immediate adoption of more energeticremedies   speak english   said the eaglet   i don t know the meaning of halfthose long words  and  what s more  i don t believe you do either   andthe eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile  some of the other birdstittered audibly  what i was going to say   said the dodo in an offended tone   was that the best thing to get us dry would be a caucus race   what  is  a caucus race   said alice  not that she wanted much toknow  but the dodo had paused as if it thought that  somebody  ought tospeak  and no one else seemed inclined to say anything  why   said the dodo   the best way to explain it is to do it    and as you might like to try the thing yourself  some winter day  i willtell you how the dodo managed it  first it marked out a race course  in a sort of circle    the exactshape doesn t matter   it said   and then all the party were placedalong the course  here and there  there was no  one  two  three  andaway   but they began running when they liked  and left off when theyliked  so that it was not easy to know when the race was over  however when they had been running half an hour or so  and were quite dryagain  the dodo suddenly called out  the race is over   and they allcrowded round it  panting  and asking   but who has won  this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal ofthought  and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon itsforehead  the position in which you usually see shakespeare  in thepictures of him   while the rest waited in silence  at last the dodosaid    everybody  has won  and all must have prizes   but who is to give the prizes   quite a chorus of voices asked  why   she   of course   said the dodo  pointing to alice with onefinger  and the whole party at once crowded round her  calling out in aconfused way   prizes  prizes  alice had no idea what to do  and in despair she put her hand in herpocket  and pulled out a box of comfits   luckily the salt water hadnot got into it   and handed them round as prizes  there was exactlyone a piece  all round  but she must have a prize herself  you know   said the mouse  of course   the dodo replied very gravely   what else have you got inyour pocket   he went on  turning to alice  only a thimble   said alice sadly  hand it over here   said the dodo then they all crowded round her once more  while the dodo solemnlypresented the thimble  saying  we beg your acceptance of this elegantthimble   and  when it had finished this short speech  they allcheered alice thought the whole thing very absurd  but they all looked so gravethat she did not dare to laugh  and  as she could not think of anythingto say  she simply bowed  and took the thimble  looking as solemn asshe could the next thing was to eat the comfits  this caused some noise andconfusion  as the large birds complained that they could not tastetheirs  and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back however  it was over at last  and they sat down again in a ring  andbegged the mouse to tell them something more  you promised to tell me your history  you know   said alice   and whyit is you hate c and d   she added in a whisper  half afraid that itwould be offended again  mine is a long and a sad tale   said the mouse  turning to alice  andsighing  it  is  a long tail  certainly   said alice  looking down with wonderat the mouse s tail   but why do you call it sad   and she kept onpuzzling about it while the mouse was speaking  so that her idea of thetale was something like this            fury said to a mouse  that he met in the house   let us both         go to law   i  will prosecute  you   come  i ll take no         denial  we must have a trial  for really this morning i ve         nothing to do   said the mouse to the cur   such a trial  dear         sir  with no jury or judge  would be wasting our breath            i ll be judge  i ll be jury   said cunning old fury   i ll         try the whole cause  and condemn you to death    you are not attending   said the mouse to alice severely   what areyou thinking of   i beg your pardon   said alice very humbly   you had got to the fifthbend  i think   i had  not    cried the mouse  sharply and very angrily  a knot   said alice  always ready to make herself useful  and lookinganxiously about her   oh  do let me help to undo it   i shall do nothing of the sort   said the mouse  getting up andwalking away   you insult me by talking such nonsense   i didn t mean it   pleaded poor alice   but you re so easily offended you know  the mouse only growled in reply  please come back and finish your story   alice called after it  andthe others all joined in chorus   yes  please do   but the mouse onlyshook its head impatiently  and walked a little quicker  what a pity it wouldn t stay   sighed the lory  as soon as it wasquite out of sight  and an old crab took the opportunity of saying toher daughter  ah  my dear  let this be a lesson to you never to lose your  temper    hold your tongue  ma   said the young crab  a littlesnappishly   you re enough to try the patience of an oyster   i wish i had our dinah here  i know i do   said alice aloud addressing nobody in particular   she d soon fetch it back   and who is dinah  if i might venture to ask the question   said thelory alice replied eagerly  for she was always ready to talk about her pet  dinah s our cat  and she s such a capital one for catching mice youcan t think  and oh  i wish you could see her after the birds  why she ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it  this speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party  some of thebirds hurried off at once  one old magpie began wrapping itself up verycarefully  remarking   i really must be getting home  the night airdoesn t suit my throat   and a canary called out in a trembling voiceto its children   come away  my dears  it s high time you were all inbed   on various pretexts they all moved off  and alice was soon leftalone  i wish i hadn t mentioned dinah   she said to herself in a melancholytone   nobody seems to like her  down here  and i m sure she s the bestcat in the world  oh  my dear dinah  i wonder if i shall ever see youany more   and here poor alice began to cry again  for she felt verylonely and low spirited  in a little while  however  she again heard alittle pattering of footsteps in the distance  and she looked upeagerly  half hoping that the mouse had changed his mind  and wascoming back to finish his story chapter iv the rabbit sends in a little billit was the white rabbit  trotting slowly back again  and lookinganxiously about as it went  as if it had lost something  and she heardit muttering to itself  the duchess  the duchess  oh my dear paws  ohmy fur and whiskers  she ll get me executed  as sure as ferrets areferrets  where  can  i have dropped them  i wonder   alice guessed in amoment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kidgloves  and she very good naturedly began hunting about for them  butthey were nowhere to be seen everything seemed to have changed sinceher swim in the pool  and the great hall  with the glass table and thelittle door  had vanished completely very soon the rabbit noticed alice  as she went hunting about  andcalled out to her in an angry tone   why  mary ann  what  are  youdoing out here  run home this moment  and fetch me a pair of gloves anda fan  quick  now   and alice was so much frightened that she ran offat once in the direction it pointed to  without trying to explain themistake it had made  he took me for his housemaid   she said to herself as she ran   howsurprised he ll be when he finds out who i am  but i d better take himhis fan and gloves that is  if i can find them   as she said this  shecame upon a neat little house  on the door of which was a bright brassplate with the name  w  rabbit   engraved upon it  she went in withoutknocking  and hurried upstairs  in great fear lest she should meet thereal mary ann  and be turned out of the house before she had found thefan and gloves  how queer it seems   alice said to herself   to be going messages fora rabbit  i suppose dinah ll be sending me on messages next   and shebegan fancying the sort of thing that would happen    miss alice  comehere directly  and get ready for your walk    coming in a minute nurse  but i ve got to see that the mouse doesn t get out   only idon t think   alice went on   that they d let dinah stop in the houseif it began ordering people about like that  by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a tablein the window  and on it  as she had hoped  a fan and two or threepairs of tiny white kid gloves  she took up the fan and a pair of thegloves  and was just going to leave the room  when her eye fell upon alittle bottle that stood near the looking glass  there was no labelthis time with the words  drink me   but nevertheless she uncorked itand put it to her lips   i know  something  interesting is sure tohappen   she said to herself   whenever i eat or drink anything  soi ll just see what this bottle does  i do hope it ll make me grow largeagain  for really i m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing  it did so indeed  and much sooner than she had expected  before she haddrunk half the bottle  she found her head pressing against the ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken  she hastily putdown the bottle  saying to herself  that s quite enough i hope i shan tgrow any more as it is  i can t get out at the door i do wish i hadn tdrunk quite so much  alas  it was too late to wish that  she went on growing  and growing and very soon had to kneel down on the floor  in another minute therewas not even room for this  and she tried the effect of lying down withone elbow against the door  and the other arm curled round her head still she went on growing  and  as a last resource  she put one arm outof the window  and one foot up the chimney  and said to herself  now ican do no more  whatever happens  what  will  become of me  luckily for alice  the little magic bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger  still it was very uncomfortable  and  as thereseemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the roomagain  no wonder she felt unhappy  it was much pleasanter at home   thought poor alice   when one wasn talways growing larger and smaller  and being ordered about by mice andrabbits  i almost wish i hadn t gone down that rabbit hole and yet andyet it s rather curious  you know  this sort of life  i do wonder what can  have happened to me  when i used to read fairy tales  i fanciedthat kind of thing never happened  and now here i am in the middle ofone  there ought to be a book written about me  that there ought  andwhen i grow up  i ll write one but i m grown up now   she added in asorrowful tone   at least there s no room to grow up any more  here    but then   thought alice   shall i  never  get any older than i amnow  that ll be a comfort  one way never to be an old woman butthen always to have lessons to learn  oh  i shouldn t like  that    oh  you foolish alice   she answered herself   how can you learnlessons in here  why  there s hardly room for  you   and no room at allfor any lesson books  and so she went on  taking first one side and then the other  andmaking quite a conversation of it altogether  but after a few minutesshe heard a voice outside  and stopped to listen  mary ann  mary ann   said the voice   fetch me my gloves this moment  then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs  alice knew it wasthe rabbit coming to look for her  and she trembled till she shook thehouse  quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times aslarge as the rabbit  and had no reason to be afraid of it presently the rabbit came up to the door  and tried to open it  but  asthe door opened inwards  and alice s elbow was pressed hard against it that attempt proved a failure  alice heard it say to itself  then i llgo round and get in at the window    that  you won t   thought alice  and  after waiting till she fanciedshe heard the rabbit just under the window  she suddenly spread out herhand  and made a snatch in the air  she did not get hold of anything but she heard a little shriek and a fall  and a crash of broken glass from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into acucumber frame  or something of the sort next came an angry voice the rabbit s  pat  pat  where are you   andthen a voice she had never heard before   sure then i m here  diggingfor apples  yer honour   digging for apples  indeed   said the rabbit angrily   here  come andhelp me out of  this     sounds of more broken glass   now tell me  pat  what s that in the window   sure  it s an arm  yer honour    he pronounced it  arrum    an arm  you goose  who ever saw one that size  why  it fills the wholewindow   sure  it does  yer honour  but it s an arm for all that   well  it s got no business there  at any rate  go and take it away  there was a long silence after this  and alice could only hear whispersnow and then  such as   sure  i don t like it  yer honour  at all  atall    do as i tell you  you coward   and at last she spread out herhand again  and made another snatch in the air  this time there were two  little shrieks  and more sounds of broken glass   what a numberof cucumber frames there must be   thought alice   i wonder whatthey ll do next  as for pulling me out of the window  i only wish they could   i m sure  i  don t want to stay in here any longer  she waited for some time without hearing anything more  at last came arumbling of little cartwheels  and the sound of a good many voices alltalking together  she made out the words   where s the otherladder  why  i hadn t to bring but one  bill s got the other bill fetch it here  lad  here  put  em up at this corner no  tie  emtogether first they don t reach half high enough yet oh  they ll dowell enough  don t be particular here  bill  catch hold of thisrope will the roof bear  mind that loose slate oh  it s coming down heads below    a loud crash   now  who did that  it was bill  ifancy who s to go down the chimney  nay   i  shan t   you  doit   that  i won t  then  bill s to go down here  bill  the master saysyou re to go down the chimney   oh  so bill s got to come down the chimney  has he   said alice toherself   shy  they seem to put everything upon bill  i wouldn t be inbill s place for a good deal  this fireplace is narrow  to be sure  buti  think  i can kick a little  she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could  and waited tillshe heard a little animal  she couldn t guess of what sort it was scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her  then saying to herself  this is bill   she gave one sharp kick  and waitedto see what would happen next the first thing she heard was a general chorus of  there goes bill  then the rabbit s voice along  catch him  you by the hedge   thensilence  and then another confusion of voices  hold up his head brandynow don t choke him how was it  old fellow  what happened to you  tellus all about it  last came a little feeble  squeaking voice    that s bill   thoughtalice    well  i hardly know no more  thank ye  i m better now but i ma deal too flustered to tell you all i know is  something comes at melike a jack in the box  and up i goes like a sky rocket   so you did  old fellow   said the others  we must burn the house down   said the rabbit s voice  and alicecalled out as loud as she could   if you do  i ll set dinah at you  there was a dead silence instantly  and alice thought to herself   iwonder what they  will  do next  if they had any sense  they d take theroof off   after a minute or two  they began moving about again  andalice heard the rabbit say   a barrowful will do  to begin with   a barrowful of  what    thought alice  but she had not long to doubt for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at thewindow  and some of them hit her in the face   i ll put a stop tothis   she said to herself  and shouted out   you d better not do thatagain   which produced another dead silence alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning intolittle cakes as they lay on the floor  and a bright idea came into herhead   if i eat one of these cakes   she thought   it s sure to make some  change in my size  and as it can t possibly make me larger  itmust make me smaller  i suppose  so she swallowed one of the cakes  and was delighted to find that shebegan shrinking directly  as soon as she was small enough to getthrough the door  she ran out of the house  and found quite a crowd oflittle animals and birds waiting outside  the poor little lizard  bill was in the middle  being held up by two guinea pigs  who were giving itsomething out of a bottle  they all made a rush at alice the moment sheappeared  but she ran off as hard as she could  and soon found herselfsafe in a thick wood  the first thing i ve got to do   said alice to herself  as shewandered about in the wood   is to grow to my right size again  and thesecond thing is to find my way into that lovely garden  i think thatwill be the best plan  it sounded an excellent plan  no doubt  and very neatly and simplyarranged  the only difficulty was  that she had not the smallest ideahow to set about it  and while she was peering about anxiously amongthe trees  a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in agreat hurry an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes  andfeebly stretching out one paw  trying to touch her   poor littlething   said alice  in a coaxing tone  and she tried hard to whistle toit  but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that itmight be hungry  in which case it would be very likely to eat her up inspite of all her coaxing hardly knowing what she did  she picked up a little bit of stick  andheld it out to the puppy  whereupon the puppy jumped into the air offall its feet at once  with a yelp of delight  and rushed at the stick and made believe to worry it  then alice dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run over  and the moment she appeared on theother side  the puppy made another rush at the stick  and tumbled headover heels in its hurry to get hold of it  then alice  thinking it wasvery like having a game of play with a cart horse  and expecting everymoment to be trampled under its feet  ran round the thistle again  thenthe puppy began a series of short charges at the stick  running a verylittle way forwards each time and a long way back  and barking hoarselyall the while  till at last it sat down a good way off  panting  withits tongue hanging out of its mouth  and its great eyes half shut this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape  so sheset off at once  and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath and till the puppy s bark sounded quite faint in the distance  and yet what a dear little puppy it was   said alice  as she leantagainst a buttercup to rest herself  and fanned herself with one of theleaves   i should have liked teaching it tricks very much  if if i donly been the right size to do it  oh dear  i d nearly forgotten thati ve got to grow up again  let me see how  is  it to be managed  isuppose i ought to eat or drink something or other  but the greatquestion is  what  the great question certainly was  what  alice looked all round her atthe flowers and the blades of grass  but she did not see anything thatlooked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances there was a large mushroom growing near her  about the same height asherself  and when she had looked under it  and on both sides of it  andbehind it  it occurred to her that she might as well look and see whatwas on the top of it she stretched herself up on tiptoe  and peeped over the edge of themushroom  and her eyes immediately met those of a large bluecaterpillar  that was sitting on the top with its arms folded  quietlysmoking a long hookah  and taking not the smallest notice of her or ofanything else chapter v advice from a caterpillarthe caterpillar and alice looked at each other for some time insilence  at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth  andaddressed her in a languid  sleepy voice  who are  you    said the caterpillar this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation  alice replied rather shyly   i i hardly know  sir  just at present at least i knowwho i  was  when i got up this morning  but i think i must have beenchanged several times since then   what do you mean by that   said the caterpillar sternly   explainyourself   i can t explain  myself   i m afraid  sir   said alice   because i mnot myself  you see   i don t see   said the caterpillar  i m afraid i can t put it more clearly   alice replied very politely  for i can t understand it myself to begin with  and being so manydifferent sizes in a day is very confusing   it isn t   said the caterpillar  well  perhaps you haven t found it so yet   said alice   but when youhave to turn into a chrysalis you will some day  you know and thenafter that into a butterfly  i should think you ll feel it a littlequeer  won t you   not a bit   said the caterpillar  well  perhaps your feelings may be different   said alice   all i knowis  it would feel very queer to  me    you   said the caterpillar contemptuously   who are  you   which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillar s making such  very short remarks  and she drew herself up and said  very gravely   ithink  you ought to tell me who  you  are  first   why   said the caterpillar here was another puzzling question  and as alice could not think of anygood reason  and as the caterpillar seemed to be in a  very  unpleasantstate of mind  she turned away  come back   the caterpillar called after her   i ve somethingimportant to say  this sounded promising  certainly  alice turned and came back again  keep your temper   said the caterpillar  is that all   said alice  swallowing down her anger as well as shecould  no   said the caterpillar alice thought she might as well wait  as she had nothing else to do and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing  forsome minutes it puffed away without speaking  but at last it unfoldedits arms  took the hookah out of its mouth again  and said   so youthink you re changed  do you   i m afraid i am  sir   said alice   i can t remember things as iused and i don t keep the same size for ten minutes together   can t remember  what  things   said the caterpillar  well  i ve tried to say  how doth the little busy bee   but it allcame different   alice replied in a very melancholy voice  repeat    you are old  father william     said the caterpillar alice folded her hands  and began   you are old  father william   the young man said      and your hair has become very white and yet you incessantly stand on your head     do you think  at your age  it is right   in my youth   father william replied to his son      i feared it might injure the brain but  now that i m perfectly sure i have none     why  i do it again and again   you are old   said the youth   as i mentioned before     and have grown most uncommonly fat yet you turned a back somersault in at the door     pray  what is the reason of that   in my youth   said the sage  as he shook his grey locks      i kept all my limbs very suppleby the use of this ointment one shilling the box     allow me to sell you a couple   you are old   said the youth   and your jaws are too weak    for anything tougher than suet yet you finished the goose  with the bones and the beak     pray  how did you manage to do it   in my youth   said his father   i took to the law     and argued each case with my wife and the muscular strength  which it gave to my jaw     has lasted the rest of my life   you are old   said the youth   one would hardly suppose    that your eye was as steady as ever yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose     what made you so awfully clever   i have answered three questions  and that is enough      said his father   don t give yourself airs do you think i can listen all day to such stuff     be off  or i ll kick you down stairs   that is not said right   said the caterpillar  not  quite  right  i m afraid   said alice  timidly   some of thewords have got altered   it is wrong from beginning to end   said the caterpillar decidedly and there was silence for some minutes the caterpillar was the first to speak  what size do you want to be   it asked  oh  i m not particular as to size   alice hastily replied   only onedoesn t like changing so often  you know   i  don t  know   said the caterpillar alice said nothing  she had never been so much contradicted in her lifebefore  and she felt that she was losing her temper  are you content now   said the caterpillar  well  i should like to be a  little  larger  sir  if you wouldn tmind   said alice   three inches is such a wretched height to be   it is a very good height indeed   said the caterpillar angrily rearing itself upright as it spoke  it was exactly three inches high   but i m not used to it   pleaded poor alice in a piteous tone  and shethought of herself   i wish the creatures wouldn t be so easilyoffended   you ll get used to it in time   said the caterpillar  and it put thehookah into its mouth and began smoking again this time alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again  in aminute or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth andyawned once or twice  and shook itself  then it got down off themushroom  and crawled away in the grass  merely remarking as it went  one side will make you grow taller  and the other side will make yougrow shorter   one side of  what   the other side of  what    thought alice toherself  of the mushroom   said the caterpillar  just as if she had asked italoud  and in another moment it was out of sight alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute trying to make out which were the two sides of it  and as it wasperfectly round  she found this a very difficult question  however  atlast she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go  and brokeoff a bit of the edge with each hand  and now which is which   she said to herself  and nibbled a little ofthe right hand bit to try the effect  the next moment she felt aviolent blow underneath her chin  it had struck her foot she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change  but she feltthat there was no time to be lost  as she was shrinking rapidly  so sheset to work at once to eat some of the other bit  her chin was pressedso closely against her foot  that there was hardly room to open hermouth  but she did it at last  and managed to swallow a morsel of thelefthand bit                                                                                                                                come  my head s free at last   said alice in a tone of delight  whichchanged into alarm in another moment  when she found that her shoulderswere nowhere to be found  all she could see  when she looked down  wasan immense length of neck  which seemed to rise like a stalk out of asea of green leaves that lay far below her  what  can  all that green stuff be   said alice   and where  have  myshoulders got to  and oh  my poor hands  how is it i can t see you  she was moving them about as she spoke  but no result seemed to follow except a little shaking among the distant green leaves as there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head she tried to get her head down to them  and was delighted to find thather neck would bend about easily in any direction  like a serpent  shehad just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag  and wasgoing to dive in among the leaves  which she found to be nothing butthe tops of the trees under which she had been wandering  when a sharphiss made her draw back in a hurry  a large pigeon had flown into herface  and was beating her violently with its wings  serpent   screamed the pigeon  i m  not  a serpent   said alice indignantly   let me alone   serpent  i say again   repeated the pigeon  but in a more subduedtone  and added with a kind of sob   i ve tried every way  and nothingseems to suit them   i haven t the least idea what you re talking about   said alice  i ve tried the roots of trees  and i ve tried banks  and i ve triedhedges   the pigeon went on  without attending to her   but thoseserpents  there s no pleasing them  alice was more and more puzzled  but she thought there was no use insaying anything more till the pigeon had finished  as if it wasn t trouble enough hatching the eggs   said the pigeon  but i must be on the look out for serpents night and day  why  ihaven t had a wink of sleep these three weeks   i m very sorry you ve been annoyed   said alice  who was beginning tosee its meaning  and just as i d taken the highest tree in the wood   continued thepigeon  raising its voice to a shriek   and just as i was thinking ishould be free of them at last  they must needs come wriggling downfrom the sky  ugh  serpent   but i m  not  a serpent  i tell you   said alice   i m a i m a   well   what  are you   said the pigeon   i can see you re trying toinvent something   i i m a little girl   said alice  rather doubtfully  as she rememberedthe number of changes she had gone through that day  a likely story indeed   said the pigeon in a tone of the deepestcontempt   i ve seen a good many little girls in my time  but never one  with such a neck as that  no  no  you re a serpent  and there sno use denying it  i suppose you ll be telling me next that you nevertasted an egg   i  have  tasted eggs  certainly   said alice  who was a very truthfulchild   but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do  youknow   i don t believe it   said the pigeon   but if they do  why thenthey re a kind of serpent  that s all i can say  this was such a new idea to alice  that she was quite silent for aminute or two  which gave the pigeon the opportunity of adding   you relooking for eggs  i know  that  well enough  and what does it matter tome whether you re a little girl or a serpent   it matters a good deal to  me    said alice hastily   but i m notlooking for eggs  as it happens  and if i was  i shouldn t want yours   i don t like them raw   well  be off  then   said the pigeon in a sulky tone  as it settleddown again into its nest  alice crouched down among the trees as wellas she could  for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it  after a whileshe remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very carefully  nibbling first at one and then atthe other  and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter  untilshe had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height it was so long since she had been anything near the right size  that itfelt quite strange at first  but she got used to it in a few minutes and began talking to herself  as usual   come  there s half my plandone now  how puzzling all these changes are  i m never sure what i mgoing to be  from one minute to another  however  i ve got back to myright size  the next thing is  to get into that beautiful garden how is  that to be done  i wonder   as she said this  she came suddenlyupon an open place  with a little house in it about four feet high  whoever lives there   thought alice   it ll never do to come upon them this  size  why  i should frighten them out of their wits   so shebegan nibbling at the righthand bit again  and did not venture to gonear the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high chapter vi pig and pepperfor a minute or two she stood looking at the house  and wondering whatto do next  when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of thewood  she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery otherwise  judging by his face only  she would have called him afish  and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles  it was opened byanother footman in livery  with a round face  and large eyes like afrog  and both footmen  alice noticed  had powdered hair that curledall over their heads  she felt very curious to know what it was allabout  and crept a little way out of the wood to listen the fish footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter nearly as large as himself  and this he handed over to the other saying  in a solemn tone   for the duchess  an invitation from thequeen to play croquet   the frog footman repeated  in the same solemntone  only changing the order of the words a little   from the queen an invitation for the duchess to play croquet  then they both bowed low  and their curls got entangled together alice laughed so much at this  that she had to run back into the woodfor fear of their hearing her  and when she next peeped out thefish footman was gone  and the other was sitting on the ground near thedoor  staring stupidly up into the sky alice went timidly up to the door  and knocked  there s no sort of use in knocking   said the footman   and that fortwo reasons  first  because i m on the same side of the door as youare  secondly  because they re making such a noise inside  no one couldpossibly hear you   and certainly there  was  a most extraordinarynoise going on within a constant howling and sneezing  and every nowand then a great crash  as if a dish or kettle had been broken topieces  please  then   said alice   how am i to get in   there might be some sense in your knocking   the footman went onwithout attending to her   if we had the door between us  for instance if you were  inside   you might knock  and i could let you out  youknow   he was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking  andthis alice thought decidedly uncivil   but perhaps he can t help it  she said to herself   his eyes are so  very  nearly at the top of hishead  but at any rate he might answer questions  how am i to get in  she repeated  aloud  i shall sit here   the footman remarked   till tomorrow  at this moment the door of the house opened  and a large plate cameskimming out  straight at the footman s head  it just grazed his nose and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him   or next day  maybe   the footman continued in the same tone  exactlyas if nothing had happened  how am i to get in   asked alice again  in a louder tone   are  you to get in at all   said the footman   that s the firstquestion  you know  it was  no doubt  only alice did not like to be told so   it s reallydreadful   she muttered to herself   the way all the creatures argue it s enough to drive one crazy  the footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating hisremark  with variations   i shall sit here   he said   on and off  fordays and days   but what am  i  to do   said alice  anything you like   said the footman  and began whistling  oh  there s no use in talking to him   said alice desperately   he sperfectly idiotic   and she opened the door and went in the door led right into a large kitchen  which was full of smoke fromone end to the other  the duchess was sitting on a three legged stoolin the middle  nursing a baby  the cook was leaning over the fire stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup  there s certainly too much pepper in that soup   alice said toherself  as well as she could for sneezing there was certainly too much of it in the air  even the duchess sneezedoccasionally  and as for the baby  it was sneezing and howlingalternately without a moment s pause  the only things in the kitchenthat did not sneeze  were the cook  and a large cat which was sittingon the hearth and grinning from ear to ear  please would you tell me   said alice  a little timidly  for she wasnot quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first   whyyour cat grins like that   it s a cheshire cat   said the duchess   and that s why  pig  she said the last word with such sudden violence that alice quitejumped  but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to thebaby  and not to her  so she took courage  and went on again   i didn t know that cheshire cats always grinned  in fact  i didn tknow that cats  could  grin   they all can   said the duchess   and most of  em do   i don t know of any that do   alice said very politely  feeling quitepleased to have got into a conversation  you don t know much   said the duchess   and that s a fact  alice did not at all like the tone of this remark  and thought it wouldbe as well to introduce some other subject of conversation  while shewas trying to fix on one  the cook took the cauldron of soup off thefire  and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach atthe duchess and the baby the fire irons came first  then followed ashower of saucepans  plates  and dishes  the duchess took no notice ofthem even when they hit her  and the baby was howling so much already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not  oh   please  mind what you re doing   cried alice  jumping up and downin an agony of terror   oh  there goes his  precious  nose   as anunusually large saucepan flew close by it  and very nearly carried itoff  if everybody minded their own business   the duchess said in a hoarsegrowl   the world would go round a deal faster than it does   which would  not  be an advantage   said alice  who felt very glad toget an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge   justthink of what work it would make with the day and night  you see theearth takes twenty four hours to turn round on its axis   talking of axes   said the duchess   chop off her head  alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook  to see if she meant to takethe hint  but the cook was busily stirring the soup  and seemed not tobe listening  so she went on again   twenty four hours  i  think   oris it twelve  i   oh  don t bother  me    said the duchess   i never could abidefigures   and with that she began nursing her child again  singing asort of lullaby to it as she did so  and giving it a violent shake atthe end of every line  speak roughly to your little boy     and beat him when he sneezes he only does it to annoy     because he knows it teases  chorus  in which the cook and the baby joined   wow  wow  wow  while the duchess sang the second verse of the song  she kept tossingthe baby violently up and down  and the poor little thing howled so that alice could hardly hear the words   i speak severely to my boy     i beat him when he sneezes for he can thoroughly enjoy    the pepper when he pleases  chorus  wow  wow  wow   here  you may nurse it a bit  if you like   the duchess said to alice flinging the baby at her as she spoke   i must go and get ready to playcroquet with the queen   and she hurried out of the room  the cookthrew a frying pan after her as she went out  but it just missed her alice caught the baby with some difficulty  as it was a queer shapedlittle creature  and held out its arms and legs in all directions  just like a star fish   thought alice  the poor little thing wassnorting like a steam engine when she caught it  and kept doublingitself up and straightening itself out again  so that altogether  forthe first minute or two  it was as much as she could do to hold it as soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it   which was totwist it up into a sort of knot  and then keep tight hold of its rightear and left foot  so as to prevent its undoing itself   she carried itout into the open air   if i don t take this child away with me  thought alice   they re sure to kill it in a day or two  wouldn t it bemurder to leave it behind   she said the last words out loud  and thelittle thing grunted in reply  it had left off sneezing by this time   don t grunt   said alice   that s not at all a proper way ofexpressing yourself  the baby grunted again  and alice looked very anxiously into its faceto see what was the matter with it  there could be no doubt that it hada  very  turn up nose  much more like a snout than a real nose  alsoits eyes were getting extremely small for a baby  altogether alice didnot like the look of the thing at all   but perhaps it was onlysobbing   she thought  and looked into its eyes again  to see if therewere any tears no  there were no tears   if you re going to turn into a pig  my dear  said alice  seriously   i ll have nothing more to do with you  mindnow   the poor little thing sobbed again  or grunted  it was impossibleto say which   and they went on for some while in silence alice was just beginning to think to herself   now  what am i to dowith this creature when i get it home   when it grunted again  soviolently  that she looked down into its face in some alarm  this timethere could be  no  mistake about it  it was neither more nor less thana pig  and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry itfurther so she set the little creature down  and felt quite relieved to see ittrot away quietly into the wood   if it had grown up   she said toherself   it would have made a dreadfully ugly child  but it makesrather a handsome pig  i think   and she began thinking over otherchildren she knew  who might do very well as pigs  and was just sayingto herself   if one only knew the right way to change them   when shewas a little startled by seeing the cheshire cat sitting on a bough ofa tree a few yards off the cat only grinned when it saw alice  it looked good natured  shethought  still it had  very  long claws and a great many teeth  so shefelt that it ought to be treated with respect  cheshire puss   she began  rather timidly  as she did not at all knowwhether it would like the name  however  it only grinned a littlewider   come  it s pleased so far   thought alice  and she went on  would you tell me  please  which way i ought to go from here   that depends a good deal on where you want to get to   said the cat  i don t much care where   said alice  then it doesn t matter which way you go   said the cat   so long as i get  somewhere    alice added as an explanation  oh  you re sure to do that   said the cat   if you only walk longenough  alice felt that this could not be denied  so she tried anotherquestion   what sort of people live about here   in  that  direction   the cat said  waving its right paw round   livesa hatter  and in  that  direction   waving the other paw   lives amarch hare  visit either you like  they re both mad   but i don t want to go among mad people   alice remarked  oh  you can t help that   said the cat   we re all mad here  i m mad you re mad   how do you know i m mad   said alice  you must be   said the cat   or you wouldn t have come here  alice didn t think that proved it at all  however  she went on  and howdo you know that you re mad   to begin with   said the cat   a dog s not mad  you grant that   i suppose so   said alice  well  then   the cat went on   you see  a dog growls when it s angry and wags its tail when it s pleased  now  i  growl when i m pleased and wag my tail when i m angry  therefore i m mad    i  call it purring  not growling   said alice  call it what you like   said the cat   do you play croquet with thequeen to day   i should like it very much   said alice   but i haven t been invitedyet   you ll see me there   said the cat  and vanished alice was not much surprised at this  she was getting so used to queerthings happening  while she was looking at the place where it had been it suddenly appeared again  by the bye  what became of the baby   said the cat   i d nearlyforgotten to ask   it turned into a pig   alice quietly said  just as if it had come backin a natural way  i thought it would   said the cat  and vanished again alice waited a little  half expecting to see it again  but it did notappear  and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction inwhich the march hare was said to live   i ve seen hatters before   shesaid to herself   the march hare will be much the most interesting  andperhaps as this is may it won t be raving mad at least not so mad as itwas in march   as she said this  she looked up  and there was the catagain  sitting on a branch of a tree  did you say pig  or fig   said the cat  i said pig   replied alice   and i wish you wouldn t keep appearingand vanishing so suddenly  you make one quite giddy   all right   said the cat  and this time it vanished quite slowly beginning with the end of the tail  and ending with the grin  whichremained some time after the rest of it had gone  well  i ve often seen a cat without a grin   thought alice   but agrin without a cat  it s the most curious thing i ever saw in my life  she had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house ofthe march hare  she thought it must be the right house  because thechimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur  itwas so large a house  that she did not like to go nearer till she hadnibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom  and raised herselfto about two feet high  even then she walked up towards it rathertimidly  saying to herself  suppose it should be raving mad after all i almost wish i d gone to see the hatter instead  chapter vii a mad tea partythere was a table set out under a tree in front of the house  and themarch hare and the hatter were having tea at it  a dormouse was sittingbetween them  fast asleep  and the other two were using it as acushion  resting their elbows on it  and talking over its head   veryuncomfortable for the dormouse   thought alice   only  as it s asleep i suppose it doesn t mind  the table was a large one  but the three were all crowded together atone corner of it   no room  no room   they cried out when they sawalice coming   there s  plenty  of room   said alice indignantly  andshe sat down in a large arm chair at one end of the table  have some wine   the march hare said in an encouraging tone alice looked all round the table  but there was nothing on it but tea  i don t see any wine   she remarked  there isn t any   said the march hare  then it wasn t very civil of you to offer it   said alice angrily  it wasn t very civil of you to sit down without being invited   saidthe march hare  i didn t know it was  your  table   said alice   it s laid for a greatmany more than three   your hair wants cutting   said the hatter  he had been looking atalice for some time with great curiosity  and this was his firstspeech  you should learn not to make personal remarks   alice said with someseverity   it s very rude  the hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this  but all he  said was   why is a raven like a writing desk   come  we shall have some fun now   thought alice   i m glad they vebegun asking riddles  i believe i can guess that   she added aloud  do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it   saidthe march hare  exactly so   said alice  then you should say what you mean   the march hare went on  i do   alice hastily replied   at least at least i mean what isay that s the same thing  you know   not the same thing a bit   said the hatter   you might just as wellsay that  i see what i eat  is the same thing as  i eat what i see    you might just as well say   added the march hare   that  i like whati get  is the same thing as  i get what i like    you might just as well say   added the dormouse  who seemed to betalking in his sleep   that  i breathe when i sleep  is the same thingas  i sleep when i breathe    it  is  the same thing with you   said the hatter  and here theconversation dropped  and the party sat silent for a minute  whilealice thought over all she could remember about ravens andwriting desks  which wasn t much the hatter was the first to break the silence   what day of the monthis it   he said  turning to alice  he had taken his watch out of hispocket  and was looking at it uneasily  shaking it every now and then and holding it to his ear alice considered a little  and then said  the fourth   two days wrong   sighed the hatter   i told you butter wouldn t suitthe works   he added looking angrily at the march hare  it was the  best  butter   the march hare meekly replied  yes  but some crumbs must have got in as well   the hatter grumbled  you shouldn t have put it in with the bread knife  the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily  then he dippedit into his cup of tea  and looked at it again  but he could think ofnothing better to say than his first remark   it was the  best  butter you know  alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity   what afunny watch   she remarked   it tells the day of the month  and doesn ttell what o clock it is   why should it   muttered the hatter   does  your  watch tell you whatyear it is   of course not   alice replied very readily   but that s because itstays the same year for such a long time together   which is just the case with  mine    said the hatter alice felt dreadfully puzzled  the hatter s remark seemed to have nosort of meaning in it  and yet it was certainly english   i don t quiteunderstand you   she said  as politely as she could  the dormouse is asleep again   said the hatter  and he poured a littlehot tea upon its nose the dormouse shook its head impatiently  and said  without opening itseyes   of course  of course  just what i was going to remark myself   have you guessed the riddle yet   the hatter said  turning to aliceagain  no  i give it up   alice replied   what s the answer   i haven t the slightest idea   said the hatter  nor i   said the march hare alice sighed wearily   i think you might do something better with thetime   she said   than waste it in asking riddles that have noanswers   if you knew time as well as i do   said the hatter   you wouldn t talkabout wasting  it   it s  him    i don t know what you mean   said alice  of course you don t   the hatter said  tossing his headcontemptuously   i dare say you never even spoke to time   perhaps not   alice cautiously replied   but i know i have to beattime when i learn music   ah  that accounts for it   said the hatter   he won t stand beating now  if you only kept on good terms with him  he d do almost anythingyou liked with the clock  for instance  suppose it were nine o clock inthe morning  just time to begin lessons  you d only have to whisper ahint to time  and round goes the clock in a twinkling  half past one time for dinner    i only wish it was   the march hare said to itself in a whisper   that would be grand  certainly   said alice thoughtfully   but then ishouldn t be hungry for it  you know   not at first  perhaps   said the hatter   but you could keep it tohalf past one as long as you liked   is that the way  you  manage   alice asked the hatter shook his head mournfully   not i   he replied   wequarrelled last march just before  he  went mad  you know    pointingwith his tea spoon at the march hare     it was at the great concertgiven by the queen of hearts  and i had to sing twinkle  twinkle  little bat how i wonder what you re at  you know the song  perhaps   i ve heard something like it   said alice  it goes on  you know   the hatter continued   in this way   up above the world you fly like a tea tray in the sky                     twinkle  twinkle   here the dormouse shook itself  and began singing in its sleep  twinkle  twinkle  twinkle  twinkle    and went on so long that theyhad to pinch it to make it stop  well  i d hardly finished the first verse   said the hatter   when thequeen jumped up and bawled out   he s murdering the time  off with hishead    how dreadfully savage   exclaimed alice  and ever since that   the hatter went on in a mournful tone   he won tdo a thing i ask  it s always six o clock now  a bright idea came into alice s head   is that the reason so manytea things are put out here   she asked  yes  that s it   said the hatter with a sigh   it s always tea time and we ve no time to wash the things between whiles   then you keep moving round  i suppose   said alice  exactly so   said the hatter   as the things get used up   but what happens when you come to the beginning again   alice venturedto ask  suppose we change the subject   the march hare interrupted  yawning  i m getting tired of this  i vote the young lady tells us a story   i m afraid i don t know one   said alice  rather alarmed at theproposal  then the dormouse shall   they both cried   wake up  dormouse   andthey pinched it on both sides at once the dormouse slowly opened his eyes   i wasn t asleep   he said in ahoarse  feeble voice   i heard every word you fellows were saying   tell us a story   said the march hare  yes  please do   pleaded alice  and be quick about it   added the hatter   or you ll be asleep againbefore it s done   once upon a time there were three little sisters   the dormouse beganin a great hurry   and their names were elsie  lacie  and tillie  andthey lived at the bottom of a well   what did they live on   said alice  who always took a great interestin questions of eating and drinking  they lived on treacle   said the dormouse  after thinking a minute ortwo  they couldn t have done that  you know   alice gently remarked  they d have been ill   so they were   said the dormouse    very  ill  alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways ofliving would be like  but it puzzled her too much  so she went on   butwhy did they live at the bottom of a well   take some more tea   the march hare said to alice  very earnestly  i ve had nothing yet   alice replied in an offended tone   so i can ttake more   you mean you can t take  less    said the hatter   it s very easy totake  more  than nothing   nobody asked  your  opinion   said alice  who s making personal remarks now   the hatter asked triumphantly alice did not quite know what to say to this  so she helped herself tosome tea and bread and butter  and then turned to the dormouse  andrepeated her question   why did they live at the bottom of a well  the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it  and thensaid   it was a treacle well   there s no such thing   alice was beginning very angrily  but thehatter and the march hare went  sh  sh   and the dormouse sulkilyremarked   if you can t be civil  you d better finish the story foryourself   no  please go on   alice said very humbly   i won t interrupt again  idare say there may be  one    one  indeed   said the dormouse indignantly  however  he consented togo on   and so these three little sisters they were learning to draw you know   what did they draw   said alice  quite forgetting her promise  treacle   said the dormouse  without considering at all this time  i want a clean cup   interrupted the hatter   let s all move one placeon  he moved on as he spoke  and the dormouse followed him  the march haremoved into the dormouse s place  and alice rather unwillingly took theplace of the march hare  the hatter was the only one who got anyadvantage from the change  and alice was a good deal worse off thanbefore  as the march hare had just upset the milk jug into his plate alice did not wish to offend the dormouse again  so she began verycautiously   but i don t understand  where did they draw the treaclefrom   you can draw water out of a water well   said the hatter   so i shouldthink you could draw treacle out of a treacle well eh  stupid   but they were  in  the well   alice said to the dormouse  not choosingto notice this last remark  of course they were   said the dormouse    well in  this answer so confused poor alice  that she let the dormouse go on forsome time without interrupting it  they were learning to draw   the dormouse went on  yawning and rubbingits eyes  for it was getting very sleepy   and they drew all manner ofthings everything that begins with an m   why with an m   said alice  why not   said the march hare alice was silent the dormouse had closed its eyes by this time  and was going off into adoze  but  on being pinched by the hatter  it woke up again with alittle shriek  and went on    that begins with an m  such asmouse traps  and the moon  and memory  and muchness you know you saythings are  much of a muchness  did you ever see such a thing as adrawing of a muchness   really  now you ask me   said alice  very much confused   i don tthink   then you shouldn t talk   said the hatter this piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear  she got up ingreat disgust  and walked off  the dormouse fell asleep instantly  andneither of the others took the least notice of her going  though shelooked back once or twice  half hoping that they would call after her the last time she saw them  they were trying to put the dormouse intothe teapot  at any rate i ll never go  there  again   said alice as she picked herway through the wood   it s the stupidest tea party i ever was at inall my life  just as she said this  she noticed that one of the trees had a doorleading right into it   that s very curious   she thought   buteverything s curious today  i think i may as well go in at once   andin she went once more she found herself in the long hall  and close to the littleglass table   now  i ll manage better this time   she said to herself and began by taking the little golden key  and unlocking the door thatled into the garden  then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it in her pocket  till she was about a foothigh  then she walked down the little passage  and  then  she foundherself at last in the beautiful garden  among the bright flower bedsand the cool fountains chapter viii the queen s croquet grounda large rose tree stood near the entrance of the garden  the rosesgrowing on it were white  but there were three gardeners at it  busilypainting them red  alice thought this a very curious thing  and shewent nearer to watch them  and just as she came up to them she heardone of them say   look out now  five  don t go splashing paint over melike that   i couldn t help it   said five  in a sulky tone   seven jogged myelbow  on which seven looked up and said   that s right  five  always lay theblame on others    you d  better not talk   said five   i heard the queen say onlyyesterday you deserved to be beheaded   what for   said the one who had spoken first  that s none of  your  business  two   said seven  yes  it  is  his business   said five   and i ll tell him it was forbringing the cook tulip roots instead of onions  seven flung down his brush  and had just begun  well  of all the unjustthings   when his eye chanced to fall upon alice  as she stood watchingthem  and he checked himself suddenly  the others looked round also and all of them bowed low  would you tell me   said alice  a little timidly   why you arepainting those roses  five and seven said nothing  but looked at two  two began in a lowvoice   why the fact is  you see  miss  this here ought to have been a red  rose tree  and we put a white one in by mistake  and if the queenwas to find it out  we should all have our heads cut off  you know  soyou see  miss  we re doing our best  afore she comes  to   at thismoment five  who had been anxiously looking across the garden  calledout  the queen  the queen   and the three gardeners instantly threwthemselves flat upon their faces  there was a sound of many footsteps and alice looked round  eager to see the queen first came ten soldiers carrying clubs  these were all shaped like thethree gardeners  oblong and flat  with their hands and feet at thecorners  next the ten courtiers  these were ornamented all over withdiamonds  and walked two and two  as the soldiers did  after these camethe royal children  there were ten of them  and the little dears camejumping merrily along hand in hand  in couples  they were allornamented with hearts  next came the guests  mostly kings and queens and among them alice recognised the white rabbit  it was talking in ahurried nervous manner  smiling at everything that was said  and wentby without noticing her  then followed the knave of hearts  carryingthe king s crown on a crimson velvet cushion  and  last of all thisgrand procession  came the king and queen of hearts alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her facelike the three gardeners  but she could not remember ever having heardof such a rule at processions   and besides  what would be the use of aprocession   thought she   if people had all to lie down upon theirfaces  so that they couldn t see it   so she stood still where she was and waited when the procession came opposite to alice  they all stopped and lookedat her  and the queen said severely  who is this   she said it to theknave of hearts  who only bowed and smiled in reply  idiot   said the queen  tossing her head impatiently  and  turning toalice  she went on   what s your name  child   my name is alice  so please your majesty   said alice very politely but she added  to herself   why  they re only a pack of cards  afterall  i needn t be afraid of them   and who are  these    said the queen  pointing to the three gardenerswho were lying round the rose tree  for  you see  as they were lying ontheir faces  and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest ofthe pack  she could not tell whether they were gardeners  or soldiers or courtiers  or three of her own children  how should  i  know   said alice  surprised at her own courage   it sno business of  mine   the queen turned crimson with fury  and  after glaring at her for amoment like a wild beast  screamed  off with her head  off   nonsense   said alice  very loudly and decidedly  and the queen wassilent the king laid his hand upon her arm  and timidly said  consider  mydear  she is only a child  the queen turned angrily away from him  and said to the knave  turnthem over  the knave did so  very carefully  with one foot  get up   said the queen  in a shrill  loud voice  and the threegardeners instantly jumped up  and began bowing to the king  the queen the royal children  and everybody else  leave off that   screamed the queen   you make me giddy   and then turning to the rose tree  she went on   what  have  you been doinghere   may it please your majesty   said two  in a very humble tone  goingdown on one knee as he spoke   we were trying    i  see   said the queen  who had meanwhile been examining the roses  off with their heads   and the procession moved on  three of thesoldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners  who ranto alice for protection  you shan t be beheaded   said alice  and she put them into a largeflower pot that stood near  the three soldiers wandered about for aminute or two  looking for them  and then quietly marched off after theothers  are their heads off   shouted the queen  their heads are gone  if it please your majesty   the soldiers shoutedin reply  that s right   shouted the queen   can you play croquet  the soldiers were silent  and looked at alice  as the question wasevidently meant for her  yes   shouted alice  come on  then   roared the queen  and alice joined the procession wondering very much what would happen next  it s it s a very fine day   said a timid voice at her side  she waswalking by the white rabbit  who was peeping anxiously into her face  very   said alice    where s the duchess   hush  hush   said the rabbit in a low  hurried tone  he lookedanxiously over his shoulder as he spoke  and then raised himself upontiptoe  put his mouth close to her ear  and whispered  she s undersentence of execution   what for   said alice  did you say  what a pity     the rabbit asked  no  i didn t   said alice   i don t think it s at all a pity  i said what for    she boxed the queen s ears   the rabbit began  alice gave a littlescream of laughter   oh  hush   the rabbit whispered in a frightenedtone   the queen will hear you  you see  she came rather late  and thequeen said   get to your places   shouted the queen in a voice of thunder  andpeople began running about in all directions  tumbling up against eachother  however  they got settled down in a minute or two  and the gamebegan  alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet groundin her life  it was all ridges and furrows  the balls were livehedgehogs  the mallets live flamingoes  and the soldiers had to doublethemselves up and to stand on their hands and feet  to make the arches the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her flamingo she succeeded in getting its body tucked away  comfortably enough under her arm  with its legs hanging down  but generally  just as shehad got its neck nicely straightened out  and was going to give thehedgehog a blow with its head  it  would  twist itself round and lookup in her face  with such a puzzled expression that she could not helpbursting out laughing  and when she had got its head down  and wasgoing to begin again  it was very provoking to find that the hedgehoghad unrolled itself  and was in the act of crawling away  besides allthis  there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever shewanted to send the hedgehog to  and  as the doubled up soldiers werealways getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground  alicesoon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed the players all played at once without waiting for turns  quarrellingall the while  and fighting for the hedgehogs  and in a very short timethe queen was in a furious passion  and went stamping about  andshouting  off with his head   or  off with her head   about once in aminute alice began to feel very uneasy  to be sure  she had not as yet had anydispute with the queen  but she knew that it might happen any minute  and then   thought she   what would become of me  they re dreadfullyfond of beheading people here  the great wonder is  that there s anyone left alive  she was looking about for some way of escape  and wondering whether shecould get away without being seen  when she noticed a curiousappearance in the air  it puzzled her very much at first  but  afterwatching it a minute or two  she made it out to be a grin  and she saidto herself  it s the cheshire cat  now i shall have somebody to talkto   how are you getting on   said the cat  as soon as there was mouthenough for it to speak with alice waited till the eyes appeared  and then nodded   it s no usespeaking to it   she thought   till its ears have come  or at least oneof them   in another minute the whole head appeared  and then alice putdown her flamingo  and began an account of the game  feeling very gladshe had someone to listen to her  the cat seemed to think that therewas enough of it now in sight  and no more of it appeared  i don t think they play at all fairly   alice began  in rather acomplaining tone   and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can t hearoneself speak and they don t seem to have any rules in particular  atleast  if there are  nobody attends to them and you ve no idea howconfusing it is all the things being alive  for instance  there s thearch i ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of theground and i should have croqueted the queen s hedgehog just now  onlyit ran away when it saw mine coming   how do you like the queen   said the cat in a low voice  not at all   said alice   she s so extremely   just then she noticedthat the queen was close behind her  listening  so she went on   likely to win  that it s hardly worth while finishing the game  the queen smiled and passed on  who  are  you talking to   said the king  going up to alice  andlooking at the cat s head with great curiosity  it s a friend of mine a cheshire cat   said alice   allow me tointroduce it   i don t like the look of it at all   said the king   however  it maykiss my hand if it likes   i d rather not   the cat remarked  don t be impertinent   said the king   and don t look at me likethat   he got behind alice as he spoke  a cat may look at a king   said alice   i ve read that in some book but i don t remember where   well  it must be removed   said the king very decidedly  and he calledthe queen  who was passing at the moment   my dear  i wish you wouldhave this cat removed  the queen had only one way of settling all difficulties  great orsmall   off with his head   she said  without even looking round  i ll fetch the executioner myself   said the king eagerly  and hehurried off alice thought she might as well go back  and see how the game was goingon  as she heard the queen s voice in the distance  screaming withpassion  she had already heard her sentence three of the players to beexecuted for having missed their turns  and she did not like the lookof things at all  as the game was in such confusion that she never knewwhether it was her turn or not  so she went in search of her hedgehog the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog  which seemedto alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with theother  the only difficulty was  that her flamingo was gone across tothe other side of the garden  where alice could see it trying in ahelpless sort of way to fly up into a tree by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back  the fightwas over  and both the hedgehogs were out of sight   but it doesn tmatter much   thought alice   as all the arches are gone from this sideof the ground   so she tucked it away under her arm  that it might notescape again  and went back for a little more conversation with herfriend when she got back to the cheshire cat  she was surprised to find quitea large crowd collected round it  there was a dispute going on betweenthe executioner  the king  and the queen  who were all talking at once while all the rest were quite silent  and looked very uncomfortable the moment alice appeared  she was appealed to by all three to settlethe question  and they repeated their arguments to her  though  as theyall spoke at once  she found it very hard indeed to make out exactlywhat they said the executioner s argument was  that you couldn t cut off a head unlessthere was a body to cut it off from  that he had never had to do such athing before  and he wasn t going to begin at  his  time of life the king s argument was  that anything that had a head could bebeheaded  and that you weren t to talk nonsense the queen s argument was  that if something wasn t done about it inless than no time she d have everybody executed  all round   it wasthis last remark that had made the whole party look so grave andanxious  alice could think of nothing else to say but  it belongs to theduchess  you d better ask  her  about it   she s in prison   the queen said to the executioner   fetch her here  and the executioner went off like an arrow the cat s head began fading away the moment he was gone  and  by thetime he had come back with the duchess  it had entirely disappeared  sothe king and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it while the rest of the party went back to the game chapter ix the mock turtle s story you can t think how glad i am to see you again  you dear old thing  said the duchess  as she tucked her arm affectionately into alice s and they walked off together alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper  and thoughtto herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her sosavage when they met in the kitchen  when  i m  a duchess   she said to herself   not in a very hopefultone though    i won t have any pepper in my kitchen  at all   soupdoes very well without maybe it s always pepper that makes peoplehot tempered   she went on  very much pleased at having found out a newkind of rule   and vinegar that makes them sour and camomile that makesthem bitter and and barley sugar and such things that make childrensweet tempered  i only wish people knew  that   then they wouldn t beso stingy about it  you know  she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time  and was a littlestartled when she heard her voice close to her ear   you re thinkingabout something  my dear  and that makes you forget to talk  i can ttell you just now what the moral of that is  but i shall remember it ina bit   perhaps it hasn t one   alice ventured to remark  tut  tut  child   said the duchess   everything s got a moral  if onlyyou can find it   and she squeezed herself up closer to alice s side asshe spoke alice did not much like keeping so close to her  first  because theduchess was  very  ugly  and secondly  because she was exactly theright height to rest her chin upon alice s shoulder  and it was anuncomfortably sharp chin  however  she did not like to be rude  so shebore it as well as she could  the game s going on rather better now   she said  by way of keeping upthe conversation a little   tis so   said the duchess   and the moral of that is  oh   tis love  tis love  that makes the world go round    somebody said   alice whispered   that it s done by everybody mindingtheir own business   ah  well  it means much the same thing   said the duchess  digging hersharp little chin into alice s shoulder as she added   and the moral of that  is  take care of the sense  and the sounds will take care ofthemselves    how fond she is of finding morals in things   alice thought toherself  i dare say you re wondering why i don t put my arm round your waist  the duchess said after a pause   the reason is  that i m doubtful aboutthe temper of your flamingo  shall i try the experiment   he might bite   alice cautiously replied  not feeling at all anxiousto have the experiment tried  very true   said the duchess   flamingoes and mustard both bite  andthe moral of that is  birds of a feather flock together    only mustard isn t a bird   alice remarked  right  as usual   said the duchess   what a clear way you have ofputting things   it s a mineral  i  think    said alice  of course it is   said the duchess  who seemed ready to agree toeverything that alice said   there s a large mustard mine near here and the moral of that is  the more there is of mine  the less there isof yours    oh  i know   exclaimed alice  who had not attended to this lastremark   it s a vegetable  it doesn t look like one  but it is   i quite agree with you   said the duchess   and the moral of thatis  be what you would seem to be  or if you d like it put moresimply  never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it mightappear to others that what you were or might have been was nototherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to beotherwise    i think i should understand that better   alice said very politely  if i had it written down  but i can t quite follow it as you say it   that s nothing to what i could say if i chose   the duchess replied in a pleased tone  pray don t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that   saidalice  oh  don t talk about trouble   said the duchess   i make you a presentof everything i ve said as yet   a cheap sort of present   thought alice   i m glad they don t givebirthday presents like that   but she did not venture to say it outloud  thinking again   the duchess asked  with another dig of her sharplittle chin  i ve a right to think   said alice sharply  for she was beginning tofeel a little worried  just about as much right   said the duchess   as pigs have to fly  andthe m  but here  to alice s great surprise  the duchess s voice died away even in the middle of her favourite word  moral   and the arm that waslinked into hers began to tremble  alice looked up  and there stood thequeen in front of them  with her arms folded  frowning like athunderstorm  a fine day  your majesty   the duchess began in a low  weak voice  now  i give you fair warning   shouted the queen  stamping on theground as she spoke   either you or your head must be off  and that inabout half no time  take your choice  the duchess took her choice  and was gone in a moment  let s go on with the game   the queen said to alice  and alice was toomuch frightened to say a word  but slowly followed her back to thecroquet ground the other guests had taken advantage of the queen s absence  and wereresting in the shade  however  the moment they saw her  they hurriedback to the game  the queen merely remarking that a moment s delaywould cost them their lives all the time they were playing the queen never left off quarrellingwith the other players  and shouting  off with his head   or  off withher head   those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by thesoldiers  who of course had to leave off being arches to do this  sothat by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left  andall the players  except the king  the queen  and alice  were in custodyand under sentence of execution then the queen left off  quite out of breath  and said to alice   haveyou seen the mock turtle yet   no   said alice   i don t even know what a mock turtle is   it s the thing mock turtle soup is made from   said the queen  i never saw one  or heard of one   said alice  come on  then   said the queen   and he shall tell you his history  as they walked off together  alice heard the king say in a low voice to the company generally   you are all pardoned    come   that s  agood thing   she said to herself  for she had felt quite unhappy at thenumber of executions the queen had ordered they very soon came upon a gryphon  lying fast asleep in the sun   ifyou don t know what a gryphon is  look at the picture    up  lazything   said the queen   and take this young lady to see the mockturtle  and to hear his history  i must go back and see after someexecutions i have ordered   and she walked off  leaving alice alonewith the gryphon  alice did not quite like the look of the creature but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with itas to go after that savage queen  so she waited the gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes  then it watched the queen tillshe was out of sight  then it chuckled   what fun   said the gryphon half to itself  half to alice  what  is  the fun   said alice  why   she    said the gryphon   it s all her fancy  that  they neverexecutes nobody  you know  come on   everybody says  come on   here   thought alice  as she went slowlyafter it   i never was so ordered about in all my life  never  they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock  and  as they camenearer  alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break  shepitied him deeply   what is his sorrow   she asked the gryphon  and thegryphon answered  very nearly in the same words as before   it s allhis fancy  that  he hasn t got no sorrow  you know  come on  so they went up to the mock turtle  who looked at them with large eyesfull of tears  but said nothing  this here young lady   said the gryphon   she wants for to know yourhistory  she do   i ll tell it her   said the mock turtle in a deep  hollow tone   sitdown  both of you  and don t speak a word till i ve finished  so they sat down  and nobody spoke for some minutes  alice thought toherself   i don t see how he can  ever  finish  if he doesn t begin  but she waited patiently  once   said the mock turtle at last  with a deep sigh   i was a realturtle  these words were followed by a very long silence  broken only by anoccasional exclamation of  hjckrrh   from the gryphon  and the constantheavy sobbing of the mock turtle  alice was very nearly getting up andsaying   thank you  sir  for your interesting story   but she could nothelp thinking there  must  be more to come  so she sat still and saidnothing  when we were little   the mock turtle went on at last  more calmly though still sobbing a little now and then   we went to school in thesea  the master was an old turtle we used to call him tortoise   why did you call him tortoise  if he wasn t one   alice asked  we called him tortoise because he taught us   said the mock turtleangrily   really you are very dull   you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simplequestion   added the gryphon  and then they both sat silent and lookedat poor alice  who felt ready to sink into the earth  at last thegryphon said to the mock turtle   drive on  old fellow  don t be allday about it   and he went on in these words  yes  we went to school in the sea  though you mayn t believe it   i never said i didn t   interrupted alice  you did   said the mock turtle  hold your tongue   added the gryphon  before alice could speak again the mock turtle went on  we had the best of educations in fact  we went to school every day    i ve  been to a day school  too   said alice   you needn t be soproud as all that   with extras   asked the mock turtle a little anxiously  yes   said alice   we learned french and music   and washing   said the mock turtle  certainly not   said alice indignantly  ah  then yours wasn t a really good school   said the mock turtle in atone of great relief   now at  ours  they had at the end of the bill  french  music   and washing  extra    you couldn t have wanted it much   said alice   living at the bottomof the sea   i couldn t afford to learn it   said the mock turtle with a sigh   ionly took the regular course   what was that   inquired alice  reeling and writhing  of course  to begin with   the mock turtlereplied   and then the different branches of arithmetic ambition distraction  uglification  and derision   i never heard of  uglification    alice ventured to say   what is it  the gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise   what  never heard ofuglifying   it exclaimed   you know what to beautify is  i suppose   yes   said alice doubtfully   it means to make anything prettier   well  then   the gryphon went on   if you don t know what to uglifyis  you  are  a simpleton  alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it  soshe turned to the mock turtle  and said  what else had you to learn   well  there was mystery   the mock turtle replied  counting off thesubjects on his flappers    mystery  ancient and modern  withseaography  then drawling the drawling master was an old conger eel that used to come once a week   he  taught us drawling  stretching  andfainting in coils   what was  that  like   said alice  well  i can t show it you myself   the mock turtle said   i m toostiff  and the gryphon never learnt it   hadn t time   said the gryphon   i went to the classics master though  he was an old crab   he  was   i never went to him   the mock turtle said with a sigh   he taughtlaughing and grief  they used to say   so he did  so he did   said the gryphon  sighing in his turn  and bothcreatures hid their faces in their paws  and how many hours a day did you do lessons   said alice  in a hurryto change the subject  ten hours the first day   said the mock turtle   nine the next  and soon   what a curious plan   exclaimed alice  that s the reason they re called lessons   the gryphon remarked  because they lessen from day to day  this was quite a new idea to alice  and she thought it over a littlebefore she made her next remark   then the eleventh day must have beena holiday   of course it was   said the mock turtle  and how did you manage on the twelfth   alice went on eagerly  that s enough about lessons   the gryphon interrupted in a verydecided tone   tell her something about the games now  chapter x the lobster quadrillethe mock turtle sighed deeply  and drew the back of one flapper acrosshis eyes  he looked at alice  and tried to speak  but for a minute ortwo sobs choked his voice   same as if he had a bone in his throat  said the gryphon  and it set to work shaking him and punching him inthe back  at last the mock turtle recovered his voice  and  with tearsrunning down his cheeks  he went on again   you may not have lived much under the sea     i haven t   saidalice   and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster   alice began to say  i once tasted   but checked herself hastily  andsaid  no  never     so you can have no idea what a delightful thing alobster quadrille is   no  indeed   said alice   what sort of a dance is it   why   said the gryphon   you first form into a line along thesea shore   two lines   cried the mock turtle   seals  turtles  salmon  and so on then  when you ve cleared all the jelly fish out of the way    that  generally takes some time   interrupted the gryphon   you advance twice   each with a lobster as a partner   cried the gryphon  of course   the mock turtle said   advance twice  set to partners    change lobsters  and retire in same order   continued the gryphon  then  you know   the mock turtle went on   you throw the   the lobsters   shouted the gryphon  with a bound into the air   as far out to sea as you can   swim after them   screamed the gryphon  turn a somersault in the sea   cried the mock turtle  capering wildlyabout  change lobsters again   yelled the gryphon at the top of its voice  back to land again  and that s all the first figure   said the mockturtle  suddenly dropping his voice  and the two creatures  who hadbeen jumping about like mad things all this time  sat down again verysadly and quietly  and looked at alice  it must be a very pretty dance   said alice timidly  would you like to see a little of it   said the mock turtle  very much indeed   said alice  come  let s try the first figure   said the mock turtle to thegryphon   we can do without lobsters  you know  which shall sing   oh   you  sing   said the gryphon   i ve forgotten the words  so they began solemnly dancing round and round alice  every now andthen treading on her toes when they passed too close  and waving theirforepaws to mark the time  while the mock turtle sang this  very slowlyand sadly   will you walk a little faster   said a whiting to a snail  there s a porpoise close behind us  and he s treading on my tail see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance they are waiting on the shingle will you come and join the dance will you  won t you  will you  won t you  will you join the dance will you  won t you  will you  won t you  won t you join the dance  you can really have no notion how delightful it will bewhen they take us up and throw us  with the lobsters  out to sea  but the snail replied  too far  too far   and gave a look askance said he thanked the whiting kindly  but he would not join the dance would not  could not  would not  could not  would not join the dance would not  could not  would not  could not  could not join the dance  what matters it how far we go   his scaly friend replied  there is another shore  you know  upon the other side the further off from england the nearer is to france then turn not pale  beloved snail  but come and join the dance will you  won t you  will you  won t you  will you join the dance will you  won t you  will you  won t you  won t you join the dance   thank you  it s a very interesting dance to watch   said alice feeling very glad that it was over at last   and i do so like thatcurious song about the whiting   oh  as to the whiting   said the mock turtle   they you ve seen them of course   yes   said alice   i ve often seen them at dinn   she checked herselfhastily  i don t know where dinn may be   said the mock turtle   but if you veseen them so often  of course you know what they re like   i believe so   alice replied thoughtfully   they have their tails intheir mouths and they re all over crumbs   you re wrong about the crumbs   said the mock turtle   crumbs wouldall wash off in the sea  but they  have  their tails in their mouths and the reason is   here the mock turtle yawned and shut hiseyes   tell her about the reason and all that   he said to the gryphon  the reason is   said the gryphon   that they  would  go with thelobsters to the dance  so they got thrown out to sea  so they had tofall a long way  so they got their tails fast in their mouths  so theycouldn t get them out again  that s all   thank you   said alice   it s very interesting  i never knew so muchabout a whiting before   i can tell you more than that  if you like   said the gryphon   do youknow why it s called a whiting   i never thought about it   said alice   why    it does the boots and shoes    the gryphon replied very solemnly alice was thoroughly puzzled   does the boots and shoes   she repeatedin a wondering tone  why  what are  your  shoes done with   said the gryphon   i mean  whatmakes them so shiny  alice looked down at them  and considered a little before she gave heranswer   they re done with blacking  i believe   boots and shoes under the sea   the gryphon went on in a deep voice  are done with a whiting  now you know   and what are they made of   alice asked in a tone of great curiosity  soles and eels  of course   the gryphon replied rather impatiently  any shrimp could have told you that   if i d been the whiting   said alice  whose thoughts were stillrunning on the song   i d have said to the porpoise   keep back please  we don t want  you  with us    they were obliged to have him with them   the mock turtle said   nowise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise   wouldn t it really   said alice in a tone of great surprise  of course not   said the mock turtle   why  if a fish came to  me  and told me he was going a journey  i should say  with what porpoise    don t you mean  purpose    said alice  i mean what i say   the mock turtle replied in an offended tone  andthe gryphon added  come  let s hear some of  your  adventures   i could tell you my adventures beginning from this morning   saidalice a little timidly   but it s no use going back to yesterday because i was a different person then   explain all that   said the mock turtle  no  no  the adventures first   said the gryphon in an impatient tone  explanations take such a dreadful time  so alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she firstsaw the white rabbit  she was a little nervous about it just at first the two creatures got so close to her  one on each side  and openedtheir eyes and mouths so  very  wide  but she gained courage as shewent on  her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the partabout her repeating   you are old  father william    to thecaterpillar  and the words all coming different  and then the mockturtle drew a long breath  and said  that s very curious   it s all about as curious as it can be   said the gryphon  it all came different   the mock turtle repeated thoughtfully   ishould like to hear her try and repeat something now  tell her tobegin   he looked at the gryphon as if he thought it had some kind ofauthority over alice  stand up and repeat    tis the voice of the sluggard     said thegryphon  how the creatures order one about  and make one repeat lessons  thought alice   i might as well be at school at once   however  she gotup  and began to repeat it  but her head was so full of the lobsterquadrille  that she hardly knew what she was saying  and the words camevery queer indeed    tis the voice of the lobster  i heard him declare  you have baked me too brown  i must sugar my hair  as a duck with its eyelids  so he with his nosetrims his belt and his buttons  and turns out his toes   later editions continued as followswhen the sands are all dry  he is gay as a lark and will talk in contemptuous tones of the shark but  when the tide rises and sharks are around his voice has a timid and tremulous sound   that s different from what  i  used to say when i was a child   saidthe gryphon  well  i never heard it before   said the mock turtle   but it soundsuncommon nonsense  alice said nothing  she had sat down with her face in her hands wondering if anything would  ever  happen in a natural way again  i should like to have it explained   said the mock turtle  she can t explain it   said the gryphon hastily   go on with the nextverse   but about his toes   the mock turtle persisted   how  could  he turnthem out with his nose  you know   it s the first position in dancing   alice said  but was dreadfullypuzzled by the whole thing  and longed to change the subject  go on with the next verse   the gryphon repeated impatiently   itbegins   i passed by his garden    alice did not dare to disobey  though she felt sure it would all comewrong  and she went on in a trembling voice   i passed by his garden  and marked  with one eye how the owl and the panther were sharing a pie   later editions continued as followsthe panther took pie crust  and gravy  and meat while the owl had the dish as its share of the treat when the pie was all finished  the owl  as a boon was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon while the panther received knife and fork with a growl and concluded the banquet   what  is  the use of repeating all that stuff   the mock turtleinterrupted   if you don t explain it as you go on  it s by far themost confusing thing  i  ever heard   yes  i think you d better leave off   said the gryphon  and alice wasonly too glad to do so  shall we try another figure of the lobster quadrille   the gryphonwent on   or would you like the mock turtle to sing you a song   oh  a song  please  if the mock turtle would be so kind   alicereplied  so eagerly that the gryphon said  in a rather offended tone  hm  no accounting for tastes  sing her   turtle soup    will you  oldfellow  the mock turtle sighed deeply  and began  in a voice sometimes chokedwith sobs  to sing this   beautiful soup  so rich and green waiting in a hot tureen who for such dainties would not stoop soup of the evening  beautiful soup soup of the evening  beautiful soup     beau ootiful soo oop     beau ootiful soo oop soo oop of the e e evening     beautiful  beautiful soup  beautiful soup  who cares for fish game  or any other dish who would not give all else for two pennyworth only of beautiful soup pennyworth only of beautiful soup     beau ootiful soo oop     beau ootiful soo oop soo oop of the e e evening     beautiful  beauti ful soup   chorus again   cried the gryphon  and the mock turtle had just begunto repeat it  when a cry of  the trial s beginning   was heard in thedistance  come on   cried the gryphon  and  taking alice by the hand  it hurriedoff  without waiting for the end of the song  what trial is it   alice panted as she ran  but the gryphon onlyanswered  come on   and ran the faster  while more and more faintlycame  carried on the breeze that followed them  the melancholy words   soo oop of the e e evening     beautiful  beautiful soup  chapter xi who stole the tarts the king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when theyarrived  with a great crowd assembled about them all sorts of littlebirds and beasts  as well as the whole pack of cards  the knave wasstanding before them  in chains  with a soldier on each side to guardhim  and near the king was the white rabbit  with a trumpet in onehand  and a scroll of parchment in the other  in the very middle of thecourt was a table  with a large dish of tarts upon it  they looked sogood  that it made alice quite hungry to look at them  i wish they dget the trial done   she thought   and hand round the refreshments  but there seemed to be no chance of this  so she began looking ateverything about her  to pass away the time alice had never been in a court of justice before  but she had readabout them in books  and she was quite pleased to find that she knewthe name of nearly everything there   that s the judge   she said toherself   because of his great wig  the judge  by the way  was the king  and as he wore his crown over thewig   look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it   hedid not look at all comfortable  and it was certainly not becoming  and that s the jury box   thought alice   and those twelve creatures   she was obliged to say  creatures   you see  because some of them wereanimals  and some were birds    i suppose they are the jurors   shesaid this last word two or three times over to herself  being ratherproud of it  for she thought  and rightly too  that very few littlegirls of her age knew the meaning of it at all  however   jury men would have done just as well the twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates   what arethey doing   alice whispered to the gryphon   they can t have anythingto put down yet  before the trial s begun   they re putting down their names   the gryphon whispered in reply  for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial   stupid things   alice began in a loud  indignant voice  but shestopped hastily  for the white rabbit cried out   silence in thecourt   and the king put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round to make out who was talking alice could see  as well as if she were looking over their shoulders that all the jurors were writing down  stupid things   on their slates and she could even make out that one of them didn t know how to spell stupid   and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him   a nicemuddle their slates ll be in before the trial s over   thought alice one of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked  this of course  alicecould  not  stand  and she went round the court and got behind him  andvery soon found an opportunity of taking it away  she did it so quicklythat the poor little juror  it was bill  the lizard  could not make outat all what had become of it  so  after hunting all about for it  hewas obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day  and thiswas of very little use  as it left no mark on the slate  herald  read the accusation   said the king on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet  and thenunrolled the parchment scroll  and read as follows   the queen of hearts  she made some tarts     all on a summer day the knave of hearts  he stole those tarts     and took them quite away   consider your verdict   the king said to the jury  not yet  not yet   the rabbit hastily interrupted   there s a greatdeal to come before that   call the first witness   said the king  and the white rabbit blewthree blasts on the trumpet  and called out   first witness  the first witness was the hatter  he came in with a teacup in one handand a piece of bread and butter in the other   i beg pardon  yourmajesty   he began   for bringing these in  but i hadn t quite finishedmy tea when i was sent for   you ought to have finished   said the king   when did you begin  the hatter looked at the march hare  who had followed him into thecourt  arm in arm with the dormouse   fourteenth of march  i  think  itwas   he said  fifteenth   said the march hare  sixteenth   added the dormouse  write that down   the king said to the jury  and the jury eagerlywrote down all three dates on their slates  and then added them up  andreduced the answer to shillings and pence  take off your hat   the king said to the hatter  it isn t mine   said the hatter   stolen    the king exclaimed  turning to the jury  who instantly madea memorandum of the fact  i keep them to sell   the hatter added as an explanation   i ve noneof my own  i m a hatter  here the queen put on her spectacles  and began staring at the hatter who turned pale and fidgeted  give your evidence   said the king   and don t be nervous  or i llhave you executed on the spot  this did not seem to encourage the witness at all  he kept shiftingfrom one foot to the other  looking uneasily at the queen  and in hisconfusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of thebread and butter just at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation  which puzzledher a good deal until she made out what it was  she was beginning togrow larger again  and she thought at first she would get up and leavethe court  but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she wasas long as there was room for her  i wish you wouldn t squeeze so   said the dormouse  who was sittingnext to her   i can hardly breathe   i can t help it   said alice very meekly   i m growing   you ve no right to grow  here    said the dormouse  don t talk nonsense   said alice more boldly   you know you re growingtoo   yes  but  i  grow at a reasonable pace   said the dormouse   not inthat ridiculous fashion   and he got up very sulkily and crossed overto the other side of the court all this time the queen had never left off staring at the hatter  and just as the dormouse crossed the court  she said to one of the officersof the court   bring me the list of the singers in the last concert  on which the wretched hatter trembled so  that he shook both his shoesoff  give your evidence   the king repeated angrily   or i ll have youexecuted  whether you re nervous or not   i m a poor man  your majesty   the hatter began  in a trembling voice   and i hadn t begun my tea not above a week or so and what with thebread and butter getting so thin and the twinkling of the tea   the twinkling of the  what    said the king  it  began  with the tea   the hatter replied  of course twinkling begins with a t   said the king sharply   do youtake me for a dunce  go on   i m a poor man   the hatter went on   and most things twinkled afterthat only the march hare said   i didn t   the march hare interrupted in a great hurry  you did   said the hatter  i deny it   said the march hare  he denies it   said the king   leave out that part   well  at any rate  the dormouse said   the hatter went on  lookinganxiously round to see if he would deny it too  but the dormouse deniednothing  being fast asleep  after that   continued the hatter   i cut some more bread and butter   but what did the dormouse say   one of the jury asked  that i can t remember   said the hatter  you  must  remember   remarked the king   or i ll have you executed  the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and bread and butter  and wentdown on one knee   i m a poor man  your majesty   he began  you re a  very  poor  speaker    said the king here one of the guinea pigs cheered  and was immediately suppressed bythe officers of the court   as that is rather a hard word  i will justexplain to you how it was done  they had a large canvas bag  which tiedup at the mouth with strings  into this they slipped the guinea pig head first  and then sat upon it   i m glad i ve seen that done   thought alice   i ve so often read inthe newspapers  at the end of trials   there was some attempts atapplause  which was immediately suppressed by the officers of thecourt   and i never understood what it meant till now   if that s all you know about it  you may stand down   continued theking  i can t go no lower   said the hatter   i m on the floor  as it is   then you may  sit  down   the king replied here the other guinea pig cheered  and was suppressed  come  that finished the guinea pigs   thought alice   now we shall geton better   i d rather finish my tea   said the hatter  with an anxious look atthe queen  who was reading the list of singers  you may go   said the king  and the hatter hurriedly left the court without even waiting to put his shoes on   and just take his head off outside   the queen added to one of theofficers  but the hatter was out of sight before the officer could getto the door  call the next witness   said the king the next witness was the duchess s cook  she carried the pepper box inher hand  and alice guessed who it was  even before she got into thecourt  by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once  give your evidence   said the king  shan t   said the cook the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit  who said in a low voice  your majesty must cross examine  this  witness   well  if i must  i must   the king said  with a melancholy air  and after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes werenearly out of sight  he said in a deep voice   what are tarts made of   pepper  mostly   said the cook  treacle   said a sleepy voice behind her  collar that dormouse   the queen shrieked out   behead that dormouse turn that dormouse out of court  suppress him  pinch him  off with hiswhiskers  for some minutes the whole court was in confusion  getting the dormouseturned out  and  by the time they had settled down again  the cook haddisappeared  never mind   said the king  with an air of great relief   call thenext witness   and he added in an undertone to the queen   really  mydear   you  must cross examine the next witness  it quite makes myforehead ache  alice watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list  feelingvery curious to see what the next witness would be like    for theyhaven t got much evidence  yet    she said to herself  imagine hersurprise  when the white rabbit read out  at the top of his shrilllittle voice  the name  alice  chapter xii alice s evidence here   cried alice  quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment howlarge she had grown in the last few minutes  and she jumped up in sucha hurry that she tipped over the jury box with the edge of her skirt upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below  and therethey lay sprawling about  reminding her very much of a globe ofgoldfish she had accidentally upset the week before  oh  i  beg  your pardon   she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay  andbegan picking them up again as quickly as she could  for the accidentof the goldfish kept running in her head  and she had a vague sort ofidea that they must be collected at once and put back into thejury box  or they would die  the trial cannot proceed   said the king in a very grave voice   untilall the jurymen are back in their proper places  all    he repeatedwith great emphasis  looking hard at alice as he said so alice looked at the jury box  and saw that  in her haste  she had putthe lizard in head downwards  and the poor little thing was waving itstail about in a melancholy way  being quite unable to move  she soongot it out again  and put it right   not that it signifies much   shesaid to herself   i should think it would be  quite  as much use in thetrial one way up as the other  as soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of beingupset  and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back tothem  they set to work very diligently to write out a history of theaccident  all except the lizard  who seemed too much overcome to doanything but sit with its mouth open  gazing up into the roof of thecourt  what do you know about this business   the king said to alice  nothing   said alice  nothing  whatever    persisted the king  nothing whatever   said alice  that s very important   the king said  turning to the jury  they werejust beginning to write this down on their slates  when the whiterabbit interrupted    un important  your majesty means  of course   hesaid in a very respectful tone  but frowning and making faces at him ashe spoke   un important  of course  i meant   the king hastily said  and went onto himself in an undertone  important unimportant unimportant important   as if he were tryingwhich word sounded best some of the jury wrote it down  important   and some  unimportant  alice could see this  as she was near enough to look over their slates  but it doesn t matter a bit   she thought to herself at this moment the king  who had been for some time busily writing inhis note book  cackled out  silence   and read out from his book   ruleforty two   all persons more than a mile high to leave the court   everybody looked at alice   i m  not a mile high   said alice  you are   said the king  nearly two miles high   added the queen  well  i shan t go  at any rate   said alice   besides  that s not aregular rule  you invented it just now   it s the oldest rule in the book   said the king  then it ought to be number one   said alice the king turned pale  and shut his note book hastily   consider yourverdict   he said to the jury  in a low  trembling voice  there s more evidence to come yet  please your majesty   said thewhite rabbit  jumping up in a great hurry   this paper has just beenpicked up   what s in it   said the queen  i haven t opened it yet   said the white rabbit   but it seems to be aletter  written by the prisoner to to somebody   it must have been that   said the king   unless it was written tonobody  which isn t usual  you know   who is it directed to   said one of the jurymen  it isn t directed at all   said the white rabbit   in fact  there snothing written on the  outside    he unfolded the paper as he spoke and added  it isn t a letter  after all  it s a set of verses   are they in the prisoner s handwriting   asked another of the jurymen  no  they re not   said the white rabbit   and that s the queerestthing about it    the jury all looked puzzled   he must have imitated somebody else s hand   said the king   the juryall brightened up again   please your majesty   said the knave   i didn t write it  and theycan t prove i did  there s no name signed at the end   if you didn t sign it   said the king   that only makes the matterworse  you  must  have meant some mischief  or else you d have signedyour name like an honest man  there was a general clapping of hands at this  it was the first reallyclever thing the king had said that day  that  proves  his guilt   said the queen  it proves nothing of the sort   said alice   why  you don t even knowwhat they re about   read them   said the king the white rabbit put on his spectacles   where shall i begin  pleaseyour majesty   he asked  begin at the beginning   the king said gravely   and go on till youcome to the end  then stop  these were the verses the white rabbit read   they told me you had been to her     and mentioned me to him she gave me a good character     but said i could not swim he sent them word i had not gone     we know it to be true  if she should push the matter on     what would become of you i gave her one  they gave him two     you gave us three or more they all returned from him to you     though they were mine before if i or she should chance to be    involved in this affair he trusts to you to set them free     exactly as we were my notion was that you had been     before she had this fit an obstacle that came between    him  and ourselves  and it don t let him know she liked them best     for this must ever bea secret  kept from all the rest     between yourself and me   that s the most important piece of evidence we ve heard yet   said theking  rubbing his hands   so now let the jury   if any one of them can explain it   said alice   she had grown solarge in the last few minutes that she wasn t a bit afraid ofinterrupting him    i ll give him sixpence   i  don t believe there san atom of meaning in it  the jury all wrote down on their slates    she  doesn t believe there san atom of meaning in it   but none of them attempted to explain thepaper  if there s no meaning in it   said the king   that saves a world oftrouble  you know  as we needn t try to find any  and yet i don tknow   he went on  spreading out the verses on his knee  and looking atthem with one eye   i seem to see some meaning in them  after all    said i could not swim    you can t swim  can you   he added  turningto the knave the knave shook his head sadly   do i look like it   he said   which hecertainly did  not   being made entirely of cardboard   all right  so far   said the king  and he went on muttering over theverses to himself     we know it to be true    that s the jury  ofcourse   i gave her one  they gave him two    why  that must be what hedid with the tarts  you know   but  it goes on   they all returned from him to you     said alice  why  there they are   said the king triumphantly  pointing to thetarts on the table   nothing can be clearer than  that   thenagain   before she had this fit    you never had fits  my dear  ithink   he said to the queen  never   said the queen furiously  throwing an inkstand at the lizardas she spoke   the unfortunate little bill had left off writing on hisslate with one finger  as he found it made no mark  but he now hastilybegan again  using the ink  that was trickling down his face  as longas it lasted   then the words don t  fit  you   said the king  looking round thecourt with a smile  there was a dead silence  it s a pun   the king added in an offended tone  and everybodylaughed   let the jury consider their verdict   the king said  forabout the twentieth time that day  no  no   said the queen   sentence first verdict afterwards   stuff and nonsense   said alice loudly   the idea of having thesentence first   hold your tongue   said the queen  turning purple  i won t   said alice  off with her head   the queen shouted at the top of her voice  nobodymoved  who cares for you   said alice   she had grown to her full size bythis time    you re nothing but a pack of cards  at this the whole pack rose up into the air  and came flying down uponher  she gave a little scream  half of fright and half of anger  andtried to beat them off  and found herself lying on the bank  with herhead in the lap of her sister  who was gently brushing away some deadleaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face  wake up  alice dear   said her sister   why  what a long sleep you vehad   oh  i ve had such a curious dream   said alice  and she told hersister  as well as she could remember them  all these strangeadventures of hers that you have just been reading about  and when shehad finished  her sister kissed her  and said   it  was  a curiousdream  dear  certainly  but now run in to your tea  it s getting late  so alice got up and ran off  thinking while she ran  as well she might what a wonderful dream it had been but her sister sat still just as she left her  leaning her head on herhand  watching the setting sun  and thinking of little alice and allher wonderful adventures  till she too began dreaming after a fashion and this was her dream  first  she dreamed of little alice herself  and once again the tinyhands were clasped upon her knee  and the bright eager eyes werelooking up into hers she could hear the very tones of her voice  andsee that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hairthat  would  always get into her eyes and still as she listened  orseemed to listen  the whole place around her became alive with thestrange creatures of her little sister s dream the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried by thefrightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool shecould hear the rattle of the teacups as the march hare and his friendsshared their never ending meal  and the shrill voice of the queenordering off her unfortunate guests to execution once more the pig babywas sneezing on the duchess s knee  while plates and dishes crashedaround it once more the shriek of the gryphon  the squeaking of thelizard s slate pencil  and the choking of the suppressed guinea pigs filled the air  mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable mockturtle so she sat on  with closed eyes  and half believed herself inwonderland  though she knew she had but to open them again  and allwould change to dull reality the grass would be only rustling in thewind  and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds the rattlingteacups would change to tinkling sheep bells  and the queen s shrillcries to the voice of the shepherd boy and the sneeze of the baby  theshriek of the gryphon  and all the other queer noises  would change she knew  to the confused clamour of the busy farm yard while thelowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the mockturtle s heavy sobs lastly  she pictured to herself how this same little sister of herswould  in the after time  be herself a grown woman  and how she wouldkeep  through all her riper years  the simple and loving heart of herchildhood  and how she would gather about her other little children and make  their  eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale perhaps even with the dream of wonderland of long ago  and how shewould feel with all their simple sorrows  and find a pleasure in alltheir simple joys  remembering her own child life  and the happy summerdays the end '"
